March 28th, 2013:

Current Version 1.80:      All sidequests up to current date, still some
                           final walkthrough things and DLC chapters to iron
                           out, and lastly class commentaries, but otherwise
                           done~

ABOUT THIS FAQ:
==============================================================================

This FAQ used to be in shift_jis format, but I gave it a complete overhaul
in order to be more pleasant to the eye. You may see "????"'s lying around,
these are the remainders of the Japanese characters that I am in the
process of eliminating.

There is a Character Guide and Items/Skills/Weapons list after the walk-
through, all characters and weapons are there, I'm just going through the
process of giving opinions on characters as readers suggested via email.

I hope you find what you're looking for. If not, email me and I'll put it in
if I think more people could use the information!

Below are some quick answers to common questions that I decided to put up
here rather than buried in the FAQ. If you have others to suggest that you
often see are asked, then feel free to contribute!

Onward!

General Tidbits/Questions ----------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I soft reset?

A: L + R + SELECT / START

Q: Why does my language keep switching?

A: Sometimes when you do soft reset, the language does so too. This can be
   fixed by going to Extras, switching to English, and then back to Japanese
   again.

Q: Is Fame carried over to the next playthrough?

A: Yes.

Q: Which of my save files' team is sent via streetpass?

A: You can only send one streetpass team at a time. Load a save file of your
   desired team, and send them out. If you want to change it, then dispatch
   a team from another save file the same way.

Q: Why can't I reclass from a Class 2 unit to another Class 2 unit with the
   Second Seal?

A: You have to be above Level 10 in the second class in order to do that,
   otherwise you can only change to Class 1 units.

Q: What is this about reclassing earlier on being better than getting to
   level 20 first?

A: There is a total level number the game keeps track of on each character.
   So, if you go to level 20 for the first class, then upgrade and go to
   level 20 of the second, you'd be at level 40 overall. Now, if you upgraded
   from Level 10, then changed class at level 15 of the next class, then
   you would have a total level of 25 only. The reason this makes a difference
   is because EXP gain slows down the higher your total number is, and it
   can be frustrating when your unit eventually only gains 8 EXP no matter
   the kill...

   As such, it's best to learn your target skill in a class and switch over
   to gather as many as desired while still easy to do.

Q: What if Anna is at the same spot as a Risen Skirmish?

A: Then she fights as an ally. If she doesn't die by the end of the mission,
   you get a special reward.

GAMEPLAY BASICS/INFO/CONTROLS                                            [GBI]
==============================================================================

This is Fire Emblem: Kakusei (Translates to "Awakening"), the 13th entry in
the Fire Emblem series, and the first on 3DS! It was released on April 19th,
2012 in Japan, and February 4th in the USA. It will be coming out in Europe
sometime in April.

In this section, I will provide you with the general controls, though it is
pretty straightforward, so should be easy to remember and get used to!

Other tidbits such as how the general flow of gameplay should work will be
provided too, though they are covered even for non speakers in the first few
levels' tutorials, I believe, but I will say so anyway!

I try to provide a lot of info, but most of it comes from just adjusting to
it yourself, you'll learn it a lot faster just by trying it in the game itself
rather than reading about it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Things to Consider when playing:
-Soon to come!

Gameplay Controls: (Not in detail, just what the buttons usually do)
-START - This is the button to skip! You can skip the enemy turn, skip battle 
         animations, and skip cutscenes.
-SELECT - Does nothing!
-R - It allows for angle changes. On the map, it allows you to zoom in/out.
-L - It allows for angle changes. On the map, it will scroll through units,
     jumping to the next one on the map, enemy/ally/other/etc.
-Y - On a map, Y is for rapid scrolling!
-X - In battle, X will automatically combine and highlight all enemy ranges.
     Other uses are swapping weapons when ready to attack.
-B - Usually to cancel something/go back. In menus, it will take you back,
     in battle, if your turn is not completed and you're just checking
     hypothetical movements, B will let you unselect the unit.
-A - You will use this the most, as it is for selecting options, units, etc.
     Selecting units allows them to move, pushing A on nothing brings up
     a menu, selecting enemies shows their range, etc.
-Touch Screen - Changes a lot! But on maps, you can select to either view
                a character profile, a map, etc. In battle scenes, you can
                pause, change angles, etc.

Unit Actions: (Translated in the Vital Translations section, check there if
               playing the Japanese version!)

Battle Scenes:

Assuming you left Battle Scenes "On" or "Custom" in the menu:

You can control various things during the battle, mostly just cinematic
effects rather than any outcome. You can hold down A to forward the battle,
or push START to skip it. The buttons on the bottom screen allow you to
change the angle as well as pause the battle. A lot of effort was put into
being able to enjoy the battle scenes more so.

==============================================================================
READING THIS GUIDE                                                       [RTG]
==============================================================================

The guide is more of an information provider than actually guiding you through
everything in a sense. A lot of the information is readily avaliable in the
game. There is no one way to get through a level, and so it is more general 
information in that sense.

Regarding Walkthroughs:

An example of a walkthrough chapter is below:

Mode: (Walkthrough chapters will contain various modes under the same chapter
       section, and so it will be listed here as either Normal, Hard, or
       Lunataic)
Chapter XX (Number) Chapter Name
Location: (Name of where it is on the map)
Condition: (Condition for clearing the chapter)
Boss: (Boss Information)
New Characters for Use: (If you get new characters, or have the potential to
                         do so, they will be listed here.)

Map: A map like the one below will be provided, if it varies by mode, then
     a note will be made and there may be an additional mode!

   X Row
   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  2  2
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5

10[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
Y Column

The above map uses X and Y columns. All coordinates given will be in X Y order,
meaning the Row FIRST, then the Column SECOND. So, (05,09) would be the Top
Row at 05, then go down to 09 on the column. A map will not exceed the double
digits (most of the time), so these digits remain double.

If the horizontal row (X) goes beyond 25 characters, there is a special
bracket in place, which is ")" rather than "]" This is in place since
gameFAQs has a 79 character limit, and so this is so I can extend the map
beyond 25 spaces without going beyond the limitation. The way it works is as
below:

   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  2  2
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5
01[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
02[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
03[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
04[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
05[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
06[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
07[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
08[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
09[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
10[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )

   2  2  2  2  3
   6  7  8  9  0 etc
01( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
02( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
03( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
04( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
etc

X - etc
Y - etc
! - etc
etc

The example above shows additional columns in the X row, the special bracket
simply indicates where it continues from the first graph! Yet on the map
itself, it will be one long row. Makes sense, right? Since gameFAQs has no
vertical limit, it can be up and down as long as it wants, so the above only
applies to horizontal spaces.

Inside a bracket will be a mark to indicate something, for example, an enemy
may have [X] as a bracket, where as a point of interest may be [!]. It may
vary by the level, so please pay attention to the notes that will be right
below the map! (As shown by the "X - etc", "Y - etc" above).

Tips:

There will be a Tips section, or a General Strategy of sorts. I may add what
I did in some cases, and maybe an example of the sort of team I had at the
time, though since play styles vary as well as character preference, these
are just very general ways to go about winning a level.

Story Summary/Detail:

This is very tentative at the moment, but it will just summarize what is going
on right before the chapter begins for those who are interested. This section
will likely be shortened even more upon a foreign release of the game.

Other subsections of the walkthrough:

There are some subsections that contain item data and descriptions that may
be helpful. For specifics on those sections, check the respective sections.

This is a Walkthrough section for the Main Story, Side chapters, and DLC!
Enemy information will be provided (though can be seen on the map as well so
may not be in too much detail), a map that will provide information regarding
reinforcements, or recruitable units, bosses, positions, etc.

Sidequests are listed after the main story. They will be noted in the main
story when able to be unlocked, however.

They are listed separately for the mode you are playing. There will be
Normal Mode, Hard Mode, and Lunatic Modes listed. For the initial walkthrough,
Hard Mode will be priority, with Lunatic done second. Easy mode will be the
third one for those who may need it.

Starting a New Game                                                     [W000]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's get started; select "New Game" from the menu.

(Normal - Green)
(Hard - Blue)
(Lunatic -Red)
(Lunatic +, Only unlocked after above is beaten)

"Normal" is the easy mode.

"Hard" is the standard difficulty that may get hard later on but shouldn't
be too bad.

"Lunatic" means you're a lunatic for trying! But it's for those seeking a
challenge, veteran or not.

"Lunatic +" is exactly that! 

Note: The initial walkthrough assumes you do Hard mode! I will try to do a
guide for those doing Lunatic at the same time, but it will not be prioritized,
if doing Normal, then the Hard mode guide should suffice as it's an easier
version of it.

Anyway, select a difficulty!

The next menu that comes up is asking if you want to play in Casual or
Classic mode:

Casual mode means that when a unit dies, they are not gone for the entire 
game as is Fire Emblem tradition! 

This allows you to lose units without too much of a worry as you'll get 
them back again at the end of the level!

Also Casual Mode allows you to save anywhere on the map at anytime during
your turn, this means you can resume from the point you last saved at. It
will use two save file slots as temporary data that are separate from your
main game!

Classic mode refers to the classical Fire Emblem style where any character 
can permanently die for the duration of the rest of the game!

In Classical Mode is also only the suspend option, rather than the save
anywhere option, which works very differently!

For both modes, if the main character or My Unit dies, it's game over!

Take your pick! I will be assuming you chose Classic Mode for the guide, as
it will assume you are trying not to get your units killed.

Now, it will lead you to your "Avatar" character creation!

Menu 1:

The first option is male or female. Choose which you prefer with
left and right, and A to make the selection. The gender differences effect
things that relate to gender-unique classes and some stat caps and who you
can marry, but aside from that there shouldn't be much of a difference!

You can make a second file with the opposite gender, so it's not like you'll
be missing out much!

Whichever Gender you choose, the following options are the same! So press A
on your desired gender to continue.

Menu 2:

Note: You can use the L/R buttons to change the viewing angle on the model to
      see if you like the hair, etc. You can press B to go back to the 
      previous menu before you confirm at the end.

(Go back)    - Does the same as the B Button
(Type)       - The Type of person/body (Being young, middle, 
               and old it seems!)
(Face)       - The preset facial types
(Hair)       - The preset hairstyles
(Hair color) - The color of the hair, lots to choose from!
(Tone/Voice) - The voice of the character, press A to sample from your
                   selections! (The option that says ?? means "No voice")
(Continue)   - When content with the above, push A to go to the next
                   menu!

Menu 3:

It will instantly tell you to write your own name in place of the default
name "Robin."

Either way, choose a name, or keep the default, and press the green button in
the bottom left to continue! 

The menu that pops up is informing you that it will be seen on streetpass, 
as well as what your partners call you and your unit name will be displayed 
as. Saying no will take you back to edit it, you can always disable street 
pass in game so don't worry about it if you don't want to use it!

Menu 4:

Last menu!

(Go back)      - Does the same as the B Button
(Name)         - If you want to change the name again!
(Birth Month)  - Choose your month of birth!
(Birth Day)    - Choose your day of birth!
(Strong point) - Your character's strong point! Choosing any of the 
                 below will make your character excel in that stat!

                 While the terms are in the Vital Translations section, 
                 I put them  here too for your convenience!

(Weak point)   - Your character's weak point! To make up for the above,
                 whichever you choose your character will be a bit worse
                 at in terms of growth. You cannot choose the same stat
                 for both to balance it out!

Below are the categories that you can choose for Strong and Weak points:

Hit Points    [HP]
Strength      [STR]
Magic Power   [MAG]
Skill         [SKL]

MyUnit (Lv 20 for both, Recruited automatically)

Note: No map is provided as it is rather straightforward with only one enemy,
a boss that does not move, and no useful stat altering spaces.

Tips:

As it is a prologue level, there shouldn't be any difficulty, even on Lunatic
mode. Get used to how moving units around works, as the boss does not move
at all, and so you can pace yourself.

Feel free to get used to the menus, the way Player/Enemy phases work, etc.

If it is your first time, small tutorials will pop up on the bottom screen,
the images alone should give you the gist of what is being said.

For information on specific abilities/actions, refer to the Vital Translations
section!

When you're ready to go on, it may be helpful to just combine MyUnit with Krom
(select My Unit, then "combine" with Krom)

Story Summary:

"In a vision that feels neither real nor dreamed, [MyUnit] and Chrom defeat
the mage Validar. But in the vision's last moments, events take an unexpected
turn."

G - Gold Spots (Top right one has Hard Mode enemy on it)

General Strategies:

Normal/Hard

Bunching yourselves together defensively and moving as a group is your best
bet for this map, especially on the harder modes. Frederick is nice to use
for this purpose.

Doubling MyUnit with Krom and making sure Liz is always out of enemy range,
and if she can't be, then paired with Frederick for protection. Use the
obstacles on the map as a way to make up for spaces you can't occupy with
your units!

Heal when needed and safe, and proceed very slowly to the bridge, and cross
when you're sure you'll be okay!

Lunatic:

Frederick is your friend! I recommend pairing your units up, Frederick will
be able to protect Lissa this way, and Chrom and your unit should preferrably
avoid trouble. Mages are a great danger to most of your units, so prioritize
wiping them out when possible. At this point a lot of units are a danger to
anyone not Frederick, so you may have to use him as your main unit throughout,
if he gets in danger, be sure to use vulenaries.

Story Summary:

"[MyUnit] is found lying in a field with no memory. After she/he helps Chrom
fend off a band of brigands, she/he is welcomed into the Shepherds as a
tactician."

   -Lower Fort also Event Tile

This map is full of woods, which provide some defense and avoidance, so it's a
good idea to stay in the woods while moving around to keep defensive. It is
also a good idea to try and attack the enemy when they have no terrain
bonuses, but won't make too big of a difference.

Doubling up and using the fortresses defensively is useful too, they heal you
every turn and provide a good defense and avoid advantage. Try not to let
the enemy stand on them.

Be sure to keep enemy ranges active (Pushing "X"), and keeping Liz out of this
range, as well as any other weaker units that may not be able to survive a
lot of attacks. The enemies tend to group together in this mission.

When Viole and Soiree come in, try to move them up through the woods and join
your main party, either doubling them or keeping them individual.

The map is pretty straightforward, just keep doubling, using terrain, and
knocking the enemies out one by one.

Lunatic:

This map on Lunatic is a whole different story. You have to rely on using
the terrain, doubling bonuses, and luck in general. Frederick is very useful,
but there is one enemy unit with a hammer who can usually kill him in one
hit. If playing Casual, you can easily sacrifice some units here and there
during the mission; if playing Classic however, you have to move really
carefully, keeping Lissa and other units out of range. It gets really tricky.

Be sure to keep enemy ranges open, and dance your way around it, making sure
the units you want in range to attack defensively are the only ones in range.

Story Summary:

"A chaotic night in the woods brings tremors and terrors, but a swordsman
named Marth comes to the rescue. Back in Ylisstol, [MyUnit] meets Emmeryn."

The map is much more open this time, with enemies spread across going
upward. You have quite a few units, though Vake can't attack as he doesn't
have any weapons on him (for the first turn at least). Doubling units you
want to support, or that you think will work well together may be a good idea
as you advance upward. 

Miriel comes in at R on the map at the start of the second turn. She has
Vake's axe, so be sure to trade it over to him so he can do something!

The steady advance forward may be helped if you take advantage of terrain,
again, and make sure the enemy isn't being fought on fortresses. It is best
to set up defensive formations with the stronger units taking hits for the
lower units behind them, or doubled up with them. You can always unequip
weapons on units to make them just take hits without fighting back, to allow
ranged units such as Archers or Mages behind them to build up experience
without being in danger of taking damage. You can create a choke point on
the bridge to handle the northern units this way.

Of course, play as you will, the map should be fairly straightforward as long
as you keep the more vulnerable units such as Liz out of harm's way. If you
feel like you are getting swarmed, it is okay to use Frederick as your
savior.

Lunatic:

What I did was I shoved everyone to the southwest, it took some tricky
coordination that involved Frederick on the hillside for the terrain bonus
and luck, as well as keeping everyone else out of enemy ranges. It worked
out eventually with health items too. Once you get past the opening bits of
the map, the rest should be easy if you lure enemies to Frederick, who is
preferrably on a fort. Be sure your other units are far away.

Story Summary:

"Lissa introduces the other Shepherds. They head north to Regna Ferox to seek
military aid against the creatures from the woods, now named "Risen."

This is the first map you can choose to bring who you want. You have to bring
Krom no matter what. There is room for eight including him, so you will have
to leave one unit back at base as a minimum.

When you begin, there will be a cutscene, and Sumia will then join your team,
at space "S" on the map. Now when you are able to move, be sure to recruit
Callum who is "C" on the map, to your left. You must speak to him with Krom
in order to recruit him. He is a fairly useful Knight! He should be in Krom's
range right at the start of the turn.

There are quite a few Archers if playing on Hard mode or above, so be sure
to take extra care in keeping Sumia out of trouble, as they are extra
effective against her. Be sure to keep their ranges highlighted or in mind.

You can either split your team into two, or proceed one way (either left or
right), kill the enemies with the doorkeys, and then proceed up past the door
and reunite at the top. For more experience, you can always take your time
and wipe out the rest of the units. If in a hurry though, one way will be
much quicker.

If you manage to get the fighter who drops a hammer, that will help greatly
against the boss, as it is extra effective against armor. You can also use
Krom's rapier if he still has it, which he should assuming it was not broken
earlier. The boss will not move!

Lunatic: You will want to get Chrom to Kellam, recruit him, double up, and
quickly run back out of enemy range. Then, use Frederick as a lure and hope
that he can wipe out most enemies that attack him, though the archers may
cause a little trouble. Take them out the next turn if possible, Frederick
should be able to kill one (pending on his stats and who he's paired up with),
and use the rest of your units to kill the other.

Now you'll have to deal with the right side, I advise hiding the other units
and healing Frederick up, and sending him against the right side.

If you manage to survive this far, then you can use either the left or right
(I recommend left) door as a chokepoint, and let the enemies come to
Frederick. Beware of the enemy with the hammer! Aside from him, the rest of
the level should be straightforward.

Note: After completing this chapter, Sidequest 1 will unlock.

This is a pretty straightforward chapter, you simply have to move north and
defeat Marth. What may make it difficult is the fact you can only bring Krom
and 5 other members. You may want to pair compatible units together in order
to maximize, or move all units to one side to handle one side at a time rather
than dealing with both sides as you move upward.

The boss themselves aren't too difficult to deal with. If you bring Liz on
the level as a healer, just be sure to keep her out of enemy ranges as per
usual.

Lunatic: They come in swarms, the first two, then the second two, etc.
Frederick should try and take out the mages when possible, keep enemy ranges
open so he can outrun and heal when needed. Using the stairways is always
a plus.

R = Richt (From Turn 1)
M = Mariabel (From Turn 1)

When in the battle menu, position a stronger unit on spaces that will be able
to move up through the right pathway quickly, this is just to prepare for
when Richt and Mariabel show up, they will have someone that can quickly take
out the enemies nearby.

Since they will already be under your control, it is advisable to move them
south to join your main group. Two healers will provide good help considering
the map seems to encourage splitting into two groups rather than moving as
one larger one. If you choose to move as a single large group, just keep your
healers and other frail units covered, keeping enemy movement in mind. Be wary
of the flying units, as they can traverse the cliff spaces and attack you--
this includes the Boss of the level.

If moving in two groups, keep a healer in each group. The enemies will be
naturally moving right and downward to attack you, so the group going left
will have to deal with harder hits. Be wary of reinforcements in the forts,
the harder the mode the more come, as well as powerful units.

Krom's Falchion is anti-dragon, so keep this in mind when combatting the
Dracoknights. Wind magic is also effective against them, which will protect
Richt at least against them. Bows are effective too.

What usually happens is the bulk of the enemy forces are fought in the area
southwest of where Richt and Mariabel appear. If this is the case, just keep
your healers doubled if it gets overwhelming in order to keep them safe. After
the bulk of the attack is over, you can proceed north.

This map has three choke points, being the west (where Chrom starts off), east
(where your second group of units are), and center (where Marth is standing).

Gaius is in the west, since he moves up toward you, it is best to leave Chrom
there to get the thief earlier in the level. The south choke point is best
defended by a speed/resistance pair, such as Sumia/Frederick. Placing units
to block incoming enemies is the best defensive strategy to do. The boss will
eventually move himself up and enter likely through the west side.

thwarted, but Marth is revealed to be a woman --and one with knowledge of the

This map has narrow footing, but I advise a defense stance first at the start
of the chapter. The units on the map will move toward you at first, so use
the terrain and defensive units at the front with ranged units behind them.
In the meantime, watch out for the range of the Wyverns on the mountains and
the cliff, they can sneak up and attack your healers and other weaker members
rather easily.

After you wipe out the first wave, you may want to start moving to the right,
especially by the time the enemy reinforcements come from the left side where
Cordelia also appears. By turn 4-6 you should have secured the middle area,
and so be ready to face the newcomers.

The boss of the level can be taken care of easily using Falchion. Just keep
enemy ranges in mind and proceed with caution.

Note: Sidequest 3 unlocks after completion of this chapter.

This is a desert map, so be wary of the units you bring. Mounted units and
non-magic ground units will have their movement reduced. Magic users and
flying units will be fine, as well as thieves. Pairing up with those
respective classes may be a good choice, as you will have to move fairly
quickly to make it to the three villages before they run into trouble.

The Master Seal and Change Seal are fairly important, and will be of great
use to you, so you may prioritize them over the Rescue staff. However, the
more the better. As far as I know, on Hard mode, the Master Seal and Change
Seal villages aren't targeted, though, so there may not be a need to rush
after all.

One or two units can head easy and take out the three enemies easily to
secure the staff. The main force should be heading straight down to help
out Gregor and Nowi who are already your ally. They may be good doubled up
and move north to meet up with the main force.

Always check enemy movement range, as sand will effect them too. There are
some non-sand areas that may be hard to notice, so best to check and check
often!

Aside from movement, the map should be fairly straightforward. For those who
played previous Fire Emblem games --there are no items in the sand!

Story Summary:

"Chrom and Lissa learn their sister is to be put to death, and launch a
rescue mission. On the way, they battle the Grimleal: the fell dragon's loyal
followers."

This map also has sand, so movement is reduced. When you reach the courtyard,
however, movement will resume as normal.

There are several forts along the way to the courtyard, these will be useful
as you proceed. Move in groups, units doubled for protection. Be wary of
the reinforcements that will appear from behind you at the start of the level,
you do not want to be sandwiched on both sides!

Again, keep enemy unit movement ranges in mind. Libra, an NPC, will join you
when you talk to him with Chrom. He should do fairly well in protecting
himself in the meantime. He will move himself to Chrom to talk to him, so
you do not actually have to go toward him.

To get Tharja, just have to speak to her with Chrom as well --just be careful
not to kill her! She speaks a little at the start of the Enemy's first turn,
so keep where she is in mind.

Note that the choice you make will not change the outcome. It's just a choice
of character.

Story Summary:

"The rescue fails, and Chrom is forced to choose between the Fire Emblem
and his sister. To spare him and the world further conflict, Emmeryn ends her
life."

There are several theieves on this map holding very valuable items that will
make a run for it from the start. There several columns to go, so you can
tackle the map in multiple ways. Send one group west and one group north,
or you can send a group west and split someone in every column. Note that
flying units will be able to fly over the mountains that are between the
columns.

To intercept the theives, high mobility units are recommended, but also those
that can defend themselves deep in enemy territory. They will move up and then
escape from the top left of the screen.

Watch out for enemy reinforcements that will appear on the fortresses that
are on the tops of the mountains. You can easily get to the boss of the level
before they come, but if you want to stick around for experience, then be
prepared to face them!

The level should be pretty straight forward aside from the above.

Note: Before you start the next chapter, if you want Chrom to not default to
a mysterious wife, you should get an S support with a compatible unit of
your choice.

"Emmeryn's death devastates Chrom, but MyUnit offers words of support. They
depart for Plegia to settle matters with King Gangrel once and for all."

Note: You have to marry a compatible female with Chrom by this chapter or
it will default to someone else. He will default to whichever non married

This is a rather large map, so you'll have to keep long distance enemy ranges
in mind as you proceed forward. Moving as a large group may be best --be wary
of the enemy reinforcements that will arrive at the various fortresses all
over the map. Olivia will join at the start of the level, I advise pairing
her up rather than using her dancing skill for this level due to the way
the reinforcements work.

There are chests on the map, use either Anna or any other thief you may have
in order to get the Gold and Goddess Icon, two very useful items.

Thieves will run for the chests, as usual. You'll have a chance to intercept
them easier than the last level. This may also be the first time you're
fighting Class 2 units (Heroes, for instance), depending how often you
did non story chapters before this. Keep the enemy units in mind, as they
are harder hitters overall as one may expect.

Note that Gangrel will move if you're in his range. It is a good way to lure
him off of the fort you stand on, but at the same time may cause trouble if
one of your weaker units happens to wander into their range. Note that at
the edge of his range is another fort, may be best to place someone there...

Enemy reinforcements arrive at the start of the enemy's turn, so may be
a surprise for any weak units that may be nearby. Be wary of your unit
positioning on Turn 3. If you have units standing on the forts, they will
not appear, this is very useful as you can occupy the south forts easily
by turn 3.

Gangrel starts moving on his own from Turn 4, or if you get close enough.
Two of the three reinforcements from the top left on Turn 4 (hard mode) drop
useful items that may be worth looking into.

This is the halfway point of the game, congrats!

The new Wyvern Rider, Cherche, will join you at the start of the level. There
are two main paths heading up to the boss on the ship. You can split your
units to go up both ways, or stick to one large group and move together.

There are quite a few armored and mounted units, if you look around the level.
Cherche is equipped with a hammer, but it may be good to have more units with
anti armor weapons, and possibly magic users. Remember to keep vulnerable
units protected with your own armored units, and keep enemy ranges in mind.

The map is pretty straightforward!

You will get the lovely Henry when you begin the level. As he says, you
are trapped between monsters, and will have to be wary of reinforcements
that will come from the forts. Pay attention to the reinforcement turns
(listed above) and plan accordingly. It's best to split the group and make
your way up to higher ground where you won't be trapped in the middle
area too long.

Alternatively, you can form a defensive formation and let them come to
you in the center, but it may be easier to run to the hills.

Be wary if you head north, archers on the ridges are armed with long bows,
so will be able to hit you, so be sure to keep checking ranges!

The mission ends when you defeat the boss. You can either rush north to them
and defeat him, or you can stick around to get EXP. The boss does not move.

A chapter where Defense is recommeneded, be wary of the high amounts of
pegasus knights and enemy mobility. The central ship you're on has four
chokepoints that I would recommend placing strong units, with ranged units
behind them. The chest items are somewhat valuable but not of high priority
compared to survival.

When on the offensive, it is best to wipe out the bulk of units on the left
ship --minus the Boss --you can leave them for later so you are able to get
the chests.

Quite a few Pegasus Knight reinforcements will be incoming, be sure to have
high defense units so that they will be unable to harm you. Keep your weaker
units out of range, as usual.

The boss will not move, so get the chests after you wipe out everyone except
the boss.

While Say'ri can handle herself against her surrounding enemies, it may be
good to head toward her anyway, wiping out foes along the way. She has no
weapon, so can only hold out so long with the items she has.

Be wary of the Knights who will be following you from the beach; you can 
detach a group to wipe them out or confront them later. You do not want to 
get too cornered as it is rather tight in space when you clear the beachhead.

There is a mix of class 1 and 2 enemies on this map, so be wary of which
enemies are which. Otherwise, the map should be straightforward.

Story Summary:

"In Valm Harbor, the Ylisseans rescue Say'ri, a resistance leader. They set
out to free Naga's 'Voice,' hoping to inspire others to their cause."

This map has narrow points as well as wide points. The map above should help
you separate water from land, harder to tell in-game. Though, if you pay
attention to the terrain tab, you may be able to tell.

There are quite a few enemies, class 1 and 2, as well as a variety. Be wary,
as there are powerful warriors with bows which would be fatal for any of
your flying units.

When Cervantes announces reinforcements, they will be appearing in the next
few turns in the bottom area, from where you started. There will be yet
another variety of units, a lot of bow-based units. You can either turn to
handle them first for experience, or you can hurry and defeat Cervantes if
you want to end the level.

Story Summary:

"The Voice is safe, but Emperor Walhart himself is now hunting Say'ri and
company down. They must hurry to Fort Steiger to weaken his army."

Be sure to bring someone with the Locktouch ability. On this map, you're
split into three teams along the bottom. You can either send your side teams
to the center where Chrom was and proceed forward together, or stick to three
split teams. If splitting, then keep the teams well balanced with possibly
multiple healers (alternatively one with Physic going up the middle may
be able to cover them).

Class 2 enemies are on the map, and watch out for terrain advantages such as
the stairway and pillars. You will want to grab the chests after you've
secured the path for the rest of your units.

There will be a thief running for the chests as usual, you should have
plenty of time to intercept him as he runs for the left area. The Boots are
a very valuable item, you will want them. The Seraph Robe is also a very
useful item.

Say'ri will warn you when reinforcements are on the way. Be sure to check
the above map to see where and who will be coming.

main force marches on Yen'fay, while Basilio takes on Walhart despite the

Note: Lava will start to cover certain land areas as time goes on. Be sure
to move swiftly to the Boss while covering the Chests on the map as well.
There will be some small bits of landmass left over, but certainly not enough
for all your units.

By turn 7, the Bullion (M) chest will be gone, the Energy Drop and Rescue
at Turn 10, and the Change Seal at Turn 11. If you really want these items,
be sure to rush to them before those turns. If you do not make it, these
items are all avalible at stores, so do not prioritize them too much.

The map is very long, and you have to race against time before all the land
is swallowed up by the lava. You should rush the boss as quick as you can
or risk losing your units to the burn. The zones are opposite of each other.
You will notice on Turn 1, the top left and bottom right are gone. Turn 2
will see the bottom and top middle gone. Then turn 3 will see the top right
and bottom left gone. You will see it goes in order, weaving until both
sides meet at the middle.

There will be a "safe zone" near the lower middle area, if you start to run
out of room, placing your units here would be best.

Be wary of the flying units on this level, as they won't be limited like
most of your units will be. There are plenty of Warriors and Sages that will
get in your way as well that you should be wary off, and will need a well
balanced team to plow through them. Any units with Galeforce should run as
far ahead as they can to clear the way as another team follows up behind
to sweep.

Note: Sidequest 17 unlocks after this chapter.

Basilio has died as well, it is decided the time has come to finally face

This is an open field battle, meaning all sides will probably be exposed, and
you have to take extra caution as you move forward.

You can either split your forces into four groups (one goes east, one goes
west, one goes north east, one goes north west) then reunite at the middle
upper area to face the boss, or you can move as one large group and let the
enemies come to you. The forts on the map will be filled with reinforcements,
so you can get to them and cover them so reinforcements can't come, or be
ready for them if you want the experience.

If playing Lunatic, a swarm of reinforcements will come on Turn 8. Walhart
will warn of when the reinforcements come in anyway.

This map is pretty straightforward, just stay on your toes and keep enemy
weaknesses (most of them are weak to Hammers, minus Walhart who's skill
negates this).

If you want to finish the map quickly, you can put someone in Walhart's range
to make him come to you. He's pretty easy to finish off with a capable unit.

Story Summary:

"The party challenges Walhart near the capital and forces the Conqueror
to retreat. Soon they are joined by unexpected allies: the southern dynasts."

There are some valuable items on the map, so bring someone with Locktouch.

Like the previous map, there is more than one strategy to win. Either split
the group into three (one west, one east, then one north), or unite the
groups and move them as one group northward.

The middle group should be the strongest as they will face the most, as the
side groups are support and will unite with the middle group as they move
through the smaller corridors.

Reinforcements will arrive from the bottom of the map the turn after the
soldier says it. You will likely be further up, but if not, be ready for
them.

Story Summary:

"Walhart's defeat ends the war--but Lucina's dark future edges closer. Chrom
must perform the Awakening and heads to Plegia to secure the last Gemstone."

S - Column 1 and 21: From Turn 3 Onward, reinforcements (magic users with
    long ranged attacks) will appear every turn from the top to the bottom,
    every other stairway (every stairway if Lunatic mode). They are not
    listed here to save space / avoid a mess, but keep this vital pattern
    in mind.

An indoor tight space map. The catch is enemy reinforcements will arrive from
the stairways outside of your range, on the left and right sides of the map.
They will have ranged attacks to hamper your units throughout the level, and
there will be reinforcements in the main area as well.

There are chests on the map, so be sure to bring someone to open them. You
will want to stay close together and have healers ready when the enemies start
attacking from far away. You may have some spells of your own that can hit
them, but more often than not you will not have such. The sages all over the
map have long ranged magic as well, and will be raining magic down upon your
units as you proceed. Take them out as quick as you can.

To win the level you must defeat the boss, so it is possible to rush him
before being overwhelmed by the reinforcements.

Story Summary:

"Instead of handing over the Gemstone, Validar manipulates MyUnit/Avatar to
steal the Fire Emblem. The Ylisseans barely escape the castle alive."

Note: The Event that occurs after the map with Lucina is different pending
on if you're her mother (female), or married to her (male). Whichever option
you choose will have the same result.

This map has no reinforcements, and is exactly as you see it, just 13 enemies
when the boss is included. However, every enemy has a name, and some have
special weapons. These stronger units should be doubled up against, and
weaknesses exploited. 

Aversa does not move, so you will have to get up to her to finish her off and
clear the level, so the lure tactic cannot be used in order to finish the
level quicker.

Check all the units strengths/weaknesses before deploying your own units to
counter each. Be wary of the desert tiles in the north that will hamper
movement.

This chapter shouldn't be too bad if you didn't run into much trouble on the
previous level.

This is a familiar chapter, but now you have units in the bottom area as well.
Assuming you've been training MyUnit and Chrom, Validar should not be too
difficult to defeat. Pack some healing items, or use a healer with physic in
the bottom area anyway just in case.

The bottom units will be fighting in the open with enemies, as well as dealing
with reinforcements. After Validar is defeated, the barrier between the upper
and lower area of the map will disappear, allowing you to unite your units
again. You will fight Validar twice, once in his weaker form, and then in
his stronger form. His stats will boost as listed above, but he still
shouldn't be too hard to overcome. He changes location to the other "B" on
the map. Unite your forces, clear out the enemy, and then wipe out the boss.

Use pillars and stairways to your advantage. Sitting on Stairways will also
block the reinforcements from coming to them as well. You want to avoid
getting surrounded, so make sure to deal out kills per turn. Galeforce is
especially useful here, since it can make up for the loss of quantity of
units in doubling up. Validar will announce the reinforcements before they
come, as usual.

"MyUnit/Avatar and Basilio turn the tables on Validar with a brilliant
deception. The "hiero-phant" reveals him/herself to be MyUnit/Avatar's future
self."

I was being spoiler-aware, so I decided to put this new unit down here instead
of before you play the map. He appears at point "I".

This map has a lot of varying terrain that one should take advantage of.
Plenty of woods and forts scattered about. You should be sure to make use of
both of these. Covering forts will prevent above reinforcements from coming
in as well.

You can break your group into three teams to sweep the map from left to
right (upper, middle, and lower team) that can also cover each other if
needed. Alternatively, the single group charging through the middle with
enemies being drawn to them may work too. By now your units should be able
to stand their ground very well.

Be wary of the reinforcements, as they keep coming several turns in a row.
If you feel your units do not need experience, you may be better off
covering the forts to prevent the reinforcements from coming.

The enemy is a combination of mounted and flying units. The mounted units
will be bogged down in the woods, but the flying units will have no trouble,
so prioritize them if you have weaker units around. 

Story Summary:

"The evil MyUnit/Avatar has used her/his life force to resurrect Grima. To
stop the dragon, Chrom must ascend Mount Prism, perform the Awakening, and
win Naga's power."

Note: The decision at the start of the chapter will not effect the outcome
in anyway.

As you can see from the list above, the hardest thing about this map will be
dealing with the vast amount of reinforcements that will come in from all
angles. Especially on Hard and Lunatic modes, where they come much earlier
and closer together.

You may want to rush to the Boss and defeat her if not interested in the
experience points of beating the enemies. You can either move north and
split your group into two, one going west and one going east, or you can
combine them and move around either bend. Be wary of terrain and use them to
your advantage when possible.

Both sides have a balance of magic, speed, and defensive units. Check the
enemies and send in units accordingly. Watch out for enemy skills, as well
as long ranged magic users.

Note: If you have Sidequest 18 "Dead King's Lament" from the Bonus Box, you
will have access to it after this chapter on the map.

"The final battle looms, as does a choice: return Grima to his slumber with
Chrom's sword or slay the dragon in exchange for MyUnit/Avatar's life."

A - Allied Deploy Spaces

Note: The first choice that is given on this map is just for story purpose.
It will make no difference to the outcome. Everyone who comments is everyone
who comes on the map.

Amazingly you do not have to bring Avatar/MyUnit. This is it, all you have to
do is defeat the boss. However, the boss is extremely tough as expected. There
are units all around your starting location, each on a Sigil square which
boosts their standing a little.

Each Sigil square, marked M, will have reinforcements every turn until you
defeat the boss. For this reason, it is best to charge straight toward the
boss and destroy them, the less turns spent, the less enemies to deal with.

In the meantime, you should move the bulk of your group north and paired so
they'll be able to take a beating from the rest of the units.

Be wary of Grima's skills, they can often hinder how you would expect the
battle to go if not paying attention.

With Galeforce and a Dancer, you should be able to beat this in one turn,
even. Remember that Chrom's Exalt Falchion is super effective against the
boss.

Note: The second choice determines whether you will get the Crom or MyUnit
ending. Naga hints at what the outcomes will be. Saying "yes" will lead to a
Chrom-centric ending, saying "no" will lead to a MyUnit centric ending. The
epilogues for the rest of the units will be the same regardless. You can
always reload to view what the other outcome is as well, so do not take too
long to think about this!

Note: Upon completion of this chapter, when you resume game, you will still
be right before this chapter on the World Map. This is the sort of "post-
game", you can fulfill sidequests and other things then go onto the last level
as many times as you please.

This map is fairly simple, though if trying to keep Donny it can be difficult
for some. Remember that Thieves give quite a few experience and do not hit
*too* hard, though they may be fast. The requirement to keep Donny is to
level him up at least once before the end of the mission. The best idea is
to weaken enemy units with stronger ones that will not kill them, and finish
them off with Donny. Alternately, he can be paired with others to boost his
own stats. If you fail, simply restart the chapter until you get his level
up.

I paired Donny with Callum, he would do a good job weakining units greatly,
but not killing them. The next turn, I would make sure to pick a target
Donny could kill, and get the rest to kill any potential hazards in range.
Then finish the last weakened enemy in range with Donny. He only needs about
two to three kills before leveling up. 

In the starting, try not to get sandwiched on the right. Enemies coming from
the north and the west can easily lead to this. I advise filling up the two
choke points at (13, 11) and (13, 16), ensuring the west forces get jammed,
and that way you can deal with the north forces first. If Donny kills the
thief, it will be a great load of experience.

Use the walls on the map to your advantage, sealing off choke points with
strong units and using ranged units to cover them or fire over the walls as
you proceed west, then north to the chests and the boss. Be sure to wipe out
the thieves before they reach the chests. There are two chest keys on the
map, so you don't need to worry about being unable to open them.

Be wary of the Archers as you proceed, as defending those like Donny or Sumia
if you bring her may be difficult, so keep enemy ranges in mind!

X = River

This map is full of Woods, as well as bridges which usually help create
chokepoints. Keep in mind the enemy has no flying units, giving Sumia and
any other flying unit you may have a great advantage, being able to strike
across rivers easily. However, the majority of the enemies are Barbarians,
so axe users, as well as Archers, kind of balancing her advantage.

Swordfighters and ranged units would be useful for this level.

You may be a little bogged down due to woods reducing your movement in the
beginning, and so become easily surrounded by enemy forces from the east
and north. Anna can handle herself pretty well on this map for the first few
turns, so fight defensively; but keep up the movement too.

You want to move your forces east and then north east, the enemies in the
south (minus the mage) do not move until you are in range and have saved
the village, so it is best to prioritize saving Anna and the village. 
Afterward, you can move your forces south. 

You do not want to spend too much time staying defensive, as the units moving
up the eastern side of the map may overrun Anna, and if not her, a Barbarian
may destroy the village. On Hard or above, she generally starts to get
overrun by about Turn 5 or 6. She prioritizes attacking Barbarians as to
protect the village. Doubling someone with Sumia and flying them over to her
and knocking out enemies along the way is helpful, that way the entire unit
does not have to reach her quickly and can wipe out enemies in the rear.

Be wary of the Boss, as he is a Berserker, a hard hitting class. You want to
get your best sword wielding units as well as possible ranged units that may
be able to survive a hit and take him out in a single turn.

There is a massive amount of woods and mountains on this map. Your objective
is to save at least one of the three villagers. 

The villagers will come under attack very quickly, and they flee to the
west. For their safety, you best dispatch a group across the west bridge to
clear the way ahead of them, as well as a group heading to the east bridge
in order to kill those following them.

Be wary of the Pegasus Knights, if you don't take care of them soon, they will
rain on the villagers. You can either send Sumia/Cordelia out to deal with
them, or "lure" them with a unit to kill them defensively. The villagers'
ultimate destination is the bottom left, so best to take out the enemies
there ahead of time as not to worry later.

As usual, terrain is always a plus. However, remember woods will slow down
your units quite a bit, so if you're trying to save the villagers when they
get ambushed in the woods, it may be difficult if using someone like
Frederick; however pairing him up with a flying unit (Sumia/Cordelia) may
save the trouble.

You should receive a Seraph Robe and another item depending on how many
were saved.

There are three paths to go upward from, and you start off with your units
spread across the bottom. Chrom should aim to get to Anna, a very capable
unit and class quickly, and so take the middle route. She should be able
to protect herself until then. Be wary of the archer and mage combos as you
go upward.

Talk to Anna with Chrom to recruit her instantly. She can also unlock the
chests on the level if you didn't bring a thief. There will be an enemy thief
who will make a run for a chest and leave soon after, so you should work to
ambush him if possible. Depending on what he takes will effect the priority,
though.

There is a lot of terrain bonuses to take advantage of. Anna can unlock doors.
Be wary, though, flying units cannot actually traverse some of the walls, as
you will see if you check their movements.

The first of the lost child sidequests (numerically, at least). Owain will
be in the middle of the field, so it's adviseable you get over to him quickly
with either Lissa or Chrom in order to recruit him and keep him out of
trouble. He can handle a few enemies but may get overwhelmed.

There are NPC sages on the map that the enemies will target, and it is really
difficult to save all of them. (The assassin to the west will move and kill
the Sage at 08,06 as soon as the enemy turn begins, for instance). Try to
save at least one, the easiest being to the south and southwest, where your
units will reach easiest. Talking to them with any character will give you
an item, see above. They will also heal you with Physic when able.

Your units can split in two groups, one going west, and one going south,
and reunite to head southwest to the boss. Be wary of the boss, he will move
if you are in his attack range, and has the vantage and pass skills, meaning
he can go through your units, as well as attack first.

There are class 2 enemy units around the map that will hit hard if you're not
careful, so view the map and know which enemies are where!

At this point in the game it is possible you either have a super team (through
grinding in skirmishes to build supports), or an average team. Regardless,
a defensive move forward to protect the sages may be the best approach. Keep
doubling those units.

15( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
16( ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Speak with Inigo with either Chrom or Olivia, and then rush
17( ][ ][ ][ ][ ] to the inside of the fort. The entrance way may be the best
18( ][ ][ ][ ][ ] way to hold off two sides, though you can also go into the
19(T][ ][ ][ ][T] narrower corridors in order to draw them in one by one and
20( ][ ][ ][ ][ ] take them out that way.
21( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
22( ][ ][ ][ ][ ] When you get Inigo, he will remark on killing five or six
23( ][ ][ ][T][ ] enemies. The more enemies he kills, the better your rewards

25( ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Hammerne staff which can repair weapons, a very valuable
26(W][ ][ ][ ][ ] item indeed.

Be wary of the fact the enemy Assassins have the skill "pass", so they can
run right through your units and attack who they wish.

Alternatively, if the rush of enemies when you enter the fort is too much to
handle with the swarms of flying units, you can arrange yourselves in the 
woods (after getting Inigo so he doesn't rush in by himself), you can take 
care of the flying units first, then move in. You can also do this in the
entrance way while keeping out of enemy ranges from inside. Do whichever
works best for your unit types.

Inside, there are plenty of armored units with ranged units behind them, so
you do not want to get cornered by them. Be sure to deal swift, fatal blows
to give yourself room. Expect powerful ranged attacks, both magic and
physical, guarded by walls of Generals.

These are the prize items depending on how many enemies Inigo kills. They
stack up, meaning if you kill 4, you get rewards for 1,2, and 3 as well.

1 - Elixir
2 - Killing Edge
3 - Speedwing
4 - Bullion (M)

As you can tell from the map formation, this is a defensive chapter. Assign
pairs of units to each entrance way and get ready to deal with both long and
melee attacks.

Brady can be recruited by talking to him with either Chrom or Maribelle. He's
right there with you so he shouldn't be hard to get at all. His healing will
be useful, but at the moment may be a little weak to take the enemy attacks.

I advise putting your defensive units two squares away from the villagers
at the entrances, this ensures that no enemy can reach the villagers with
ranged attacks. (Though, there are enemies with Longbows that you should look
out for who may still do this). The more villagers you save, the more items
you get after the mission ends.

Likewise, if you have a single powerful unit, or a powerful pair of units,
you can send them out into the field on their own as a good distraction/lure
to take some of the heat off of the rest of the defending units. To do this
though, you will need a very self sufficient unit that will be fine fighting
on their own.

If you have several powerful units, you can take the offensive, sending units
in each direction, being sure to eliminate enemies closest to the structure
then going out farther. This requires powerful units that can handle
themselves, this ensures that the villagers will not come in harm's way
either.

Eventually, the boss will start to move down, remember that he has ranged
attacks, and take him out!

Like with other chapters, you get rewards for the more Villagers that are
saved:

1 - Mend
2 - Blessed Lance
3 - Bullion (M)
4 - Seraph Robe
5 - Recover

Note: It stacks, so if you save 4, you get items 1-4, not just item 4.

have any, but no chest keys.

Unlike a lot of the sidequests, this one still has Class 1 enemies on it.
This should make it easier. Your main objective is to get up to Kjelle before
she's done in. Being a Knight in a room with archers, though, she will
survive for a little while.

As you go up the hallway, you can send individual units to block the corridors
and take care of whatever enemies may be in there. Be wary of enemies from
the stairways, as usual.

You should be able to make it to the door by Turn 4 or 5. Be wary of all the
reinforcements that will appear on Turn 5 from the stairways, it is adviseable
you prepare in advance and get Kjelle by that time. Prioritize the chests
after you make sure your team is secure. The boss will not move, so do not
worry about the level ending without you having reached the chests. Take care
of him after you meet all your objectives.

Aside from the reinforcements, this level should be easier than the other
children-recruitment quests.

This map is an all out field battle between forces. There are NPCs on the
map, each time the boss goes to one, they will join the enemy. The faster you
get there, the less you will have to deal with if you KO the boss. They do
not move until you clear row 10 however. Also, when you clear row 10, the
boss runs back to the corner, so will no longer recruit any more NPCs. In this
case, if you can rush Row 10 safely it means less enemies to deal with.

The boss will run away from the map if you don't catch him in time. You lose
the Bullion (L) he holds, but that's it.

The enemies are mostly class 2, so you will need strong units on the front
lines. Be careful not to kill Cynthia, try to get Chrom or Sumia into her
range but unequipped so they won't attack back if she attacks them.

You can usually get to Row 10 in about three turns, by then you won't have
too many extra enemies to deal with. Though you can purposefully let him
convert more NPCs for the experience.

The level can be simple if you have pair of strong units who can stay close
together and take advantage of the terrain to best the enemies. Quite a few
Berserkers and Heroes to deal with.

    (Has to speak to Horanto to recruit! Make sure neither die)
H = Holland / Horanto (Enemy; Serena must speak to him)
A = Allied Deploy Spaces

In order to get Severa, you need to let her go talk to Holland who is located
in the north east section of the map. As you can see, the path there is
pretty dangerous for a level 10 mercenary, so I suggest sending a detachment
to assist her on her path to talk to him. You have to make sure neither of
them get killed! Speak to Severa with Cordelia or Chrom, and she will remind
you of her objectives.

Severa moves pretty quickly, so be sure to have units that can get ahead of
her for her own safety. Watch out for Sages and other ranged units that
may attack her from the other side of the wall, they usually annihiliate her
in one turn.

The group going left should be your main group, I suggest a healer with 
physic just in case Severa gets in some sort of trouble. Be sure to bring a
thief or someone with lock picking skill for the chests. There are plenty
of class 2 enemies on the map, so you should remain aware of this. There are
many Berserkers, Assassins, and Sages, with Tricksters as well. These
are rather hard hitting classes in different ways, so proceed with caution!

There is another strategy; if you have a Rescue staff, you can warp Severa
to the left side and move as one group, this works much better as everyone
is in one place and so your power isn't split between two paths. Also, if
Severa starts to run ahead of your group, use Rescue to warp her back to
the back. Repeat this until the way is clear.

Likewise, check the skills of the enemies. With Class 2 enemies, these skills
play a larger role; such as the Assassins that have Vantage. You want to
watch out for the weapons they have too, such as the Tricksters with Levin
Swords. Reinforcements will come from the stairways, too.

Unlocking the door near Holland will help Severa avoid the forces to the
southeast, though you can send a unit in front of her (using the Rescue
strategy) and wipe them out that way too. Use whichever works best to how
your units are trained/leveled.

Be very careful -- when Severa makes it to Holland and joins you, at the end
of your turn (beginning of enemy), the four central stairs will have
reinforcements. Either cover the stairways with your own units, or be ready
to face them by moving weaker units out of the way!

22( ][O][O][O][ ] This map is built for flying units, as you can see.
23(O][O][O][T][O] Doubling with flying units will do a lot of good, if you
24(O][T][O][O][N] have been an avid Pegasus/Wyvern user, then this map is
25(O][O][O][O][O] good. The other units will be limited to narrow bridges to
26(O][N][O][T][O] fight on, and they will have to be ready to get hit from
27( ][O][O][O][O] the sides by the enemy flying units.

Recruit Gerome with either Chrom or Cherche. He's right at the start of the
level, so will not be hard to reach at all.

From there, you will want to send flying units east to protect the two
villagers, as there is no bridge directly connecting your starting island
to theirs. Send some ground units west as well to protect the one in the
bottom left. Save some units for the south island, and then send a group
north to ensure the ones on the south island do not come under fire as well.

Alternatively, if you have the Rescue staff, you can warp the villagers to
you in one place, easier to defend that way if you cannot spare the man
power for dividing your units. When off a bridge and on a small island, be
sure to use terrain to your benefit.

Beware of the enemy reinforcements on Turn 5, as a swarm of Wyvern Lords will
appear from the forts in the north islands.

The enemies are all class 2, meaning you should expect hard hitting units 
as usual. Survey their skills and keep ranges in mind.

The prizes for the amount of villagers saved:
1 - Wyrmslayer
2 - Arms Scroll
3 - Recover
4 - Bullion (M)
5 - Seraph Robe

Note: It stacks, so if you save all 5, you get prizes 1-5.

Bring someone with lock picking skill in order to get the loot from the
chests.

This map has both Class 1 and Class 2 enemies all over it. Also, as you can
see, the space for non flying units to fight is very limited, so you will
have to proceed in tight spaces and narrow passages.

Flying units can protect the flanks, as well as eliminate the theives that
will likely attempt to get the chests on the map as well. Thieves will make
a run for the chests the moment the map begins. After they get their loot,
they will leave the map, so wipe them out quickly!

Speak to Morgan / Mark with either MyUnit or Chrom, you can get him/her on
the way north toward the boss.

Watch out for reinforcements that will come in from the stairway on the turns
listed above. Proceed with caution (mind enemy skills/weapons/ranges), and
this map should be straightforward.

Note that the chapter is defeat boss, meaning if you rush him you may miss
out on the rest of the experience points and chests.

You will receive "Naga's Tear" at the end of the level.

P - Enemy (Side 2)
Note: If you side with none, then both P and E are enemies.

Note: You may choose to side with one team or the other. You can also choose
to side with neither and defeat both, the most experience is from this
choice.

You will have a choice which side to side with. The Riders of Dawn (Green),
implied by the title, are mostly mounted units. They'll have trouble moving
around the woods as is, but overall are more balanced than the other team.

The Stonewall Knights (Red) are mostly defense high generals. They are also 
the ones that have Yarne, who you will need to recruit.

Siding with neither is the best experience wise, but will make the map
difficult in the sense that you are fighting twice the load. Siding with
one side will earn you about 500 G per unit killed, however, siding with
neither side will yield you 10,000 G upon completion. (This is in addition
to the two Bullion (M)'s you receive from each boss).

It may be best to side with neither. Experience and money. There are many
more units that will appear on the map for whatever team you are fighting.
If you fight both, the map will look like above.

Assuming you side with neither, a very steady defensive formation using
the terrain is best, sending Chrom or Panne on a side to get Yarne before he
gets bested by the Riders of Dawn. After this, you can retreat them back to
join the defensive formation. The Stonewall Knights are easier to fight,
especially if you have speedy units.

Yarne will attack you, so you may be best off luring him (unequip a weapon
and put a strong unit there that can evade or not get hurt by the enemy
attacks), get him close, and speak to him.

Also; note that if you fight both, they will both side against you. They will
not continue to attack one another.

This is another Desert map, meaning non-magic ground units, or mounted units,
have their movement reduced. Flying units are still safe. I suggest pairing
up with flying units and magic units so moving around the map won't be too
much of an issue.

If you reach the middle of the map, though, then you will be able to run
around normally on the plains. The hidden villages will not appear to you
until you go to the visible village. They will be in an order, the man in
the village will remind you.

First is top right, then top left, then bottom right, and he will reveal the
location of the Goddess Staff (marked G on the map), so be sure to get that.

Enemy reinforcements come each time you enter a village, so pay attention
to who comes and from where on the map above. They are often brutal in their
location and the forces that come.

The map is straightforward -- be sure to send Chrom or Miriel to the village
on the left to get Laurent. If you send someone else, the village door won't
close so you have not missed your chance, but it must be one of the two
above to keep him.

There are Class 1 and 2 enemy units, and reinforcements per village you
enter, so be extra careful as you traverse the desert. Keep enemy ranges in
mind, some of the reinforcements who come are limited by the sand, but others
are flying units that will have no problem.

This is an easy level, but the difficulty can be making it to Noire on time.
She starts off in a walled area surrounded by flying units, which she is
strong against but there are quite a few of them. You should prioritize
sending a group north to lure the flying units while getting to her before
they do.

You can send a power group west as well to deal with the swarm of bow knights,
more flying units, and the boss of the level at the same time. Again,
prioritize Noire. She will come under your command after the first turn, in
which you can choose to make her start to shoot at the flying units that are
coming toward her (they have to go around thanks to the wall, but she can
still shoot them). Or, you can make her run east then south to unite with
your group coming up, though she may get intercepted by flying units if you
choose to do it this way.

You have until about Turn 4 before she can no longer escape from the Griffon
Knight while standing where she started. Use a flying units to get to that
entrance way and cover her.

14( ] This map can be difficult. There are a lot of ranged units, and all are
15( ] class 2 enemies. There are plenty of Dark Knights, Warriors, Sorecerors,
16(X] and Generals all over the map. Some of the Sorcerors wield tomes that
17( ] have a greater range than normal so can attack you at quite the
18( ] distance.
19( ]
20( ] Remember to bring someone who can open the chests, as well as Nowi, as
21(X] Chrom cannot recruit Nah on his own.
22( ]
23( ] The walls on this level break and fix themselves at different times on
24( ] different turns. There are doors that will remain open once you open
25( ] them, but do not rely on the walls to protect you from enemies in the
other halls, as they may break down the next turn.

Keep your units doubled and in defensive positions at all times, be ready for
enemies to come through broken walls at the worst possible moment. The walls
are triggered by the area you're in, so the wall to Nah will break down when
you come close to it (in that hallway). However, with this other walls will
start to break to allow the enemy to attack you.

You should be fine so long as you are able to open the doors and hence not
rely on the walls, but it is best to keep away from them just to be sure.

Note that hugging the wall can still put you under fire from ranged enemies,
so keep ranges in mind!

Also, beware of Warriors with the Counter skill, this can be frustrating if
you rely on close quarters units especially.

As you can see from the above, this map is heavily reinforcement based. It
is a defensive level, a ring of woods around Tiki for you to station your
units. The enemies come in waves of reinforcements. They are all flying
units, so bows and wind magic will be super effective. You must protect Tiki
if you want to get her after the level.

There are multiple ways you can go about this map. Either take the defensive
and line your units up in the trees, making sure to bring archers and other
wind mages as you deal with only flying units on this level, and put stronger
defensive units in front to take the brunt of the attack as you get them from
behind. Healers with physic will be useful too.

Another way is the more offensive strategy, where you can send groups of
units to the three points (west, south, and east) and just destroy the enemies
as they come into the map. This is very effective if you have the powerful
units to do so, and it ensures that none of the enemies even have a chance
to get close to Tiki. This guide gives you who and what comes from where on
which turn, so this should assist you on lining your units up (see map above).

You may end up somewhere between the woods and their spawn point, which is
optimal as it takes them until their third turn to attack Tiki, their first
will make them end up around this zone.

Note, however, that the enemies will priortize Tiki, and so usually fly by
the units that are standing to meet them. If you have Galeforce units, then
they will be useful in taking them down before they reach Tiki, but if not,
then I suggest a third strategy.

A third is a mix of the above two, some units stay with Tiki (can form a ring
around her to ensure that the flying units can't attack), while another
detachment goes off to fight them at their spawn points. This way even if one
slips by, the crew left with Tiki should be able to handle the remainder. You
may not want to double some units in order to attack multiple enemies as you
start to get swarmed in later turns. Dancers and Galeforce will come in handy
here.

Tiki will only be able to take one or two hits from her enemies, so be very
careful. The boss starts moving after all reinforcements are dead.

16( ][ ][ ][ ][X] would usually have very powerful units, so it should not

16(T] suggest bringing units with high mobility and self sufficiency.
17( ]
18(M] The enemy goes after Emmeryn pretty quickly, she will be killed by the
19( ] second turn by the Assassin running toward her. As such, you have to
20( ] rush a group over to save her. If you have a flying unit paired up with
21(H] a unit who has Galeforce, it is really easy to get there. Add a dancer
22(H] to the mix and you will have insane mobility and have no problem dealing
23(H] with the enemies heading toward her. She does not move at all, and will
24(H] not be in use even after you talk to her. So keep an eye on her that no
25(H] flying units get around you and attack her. Viewing enemy ranges may
26(H] help in this regard.

The enemy has a general strategy, they attack you with the few sages lined up
along the middle-mountain area with long ranged attacks, and said their
Griffon Riders to ambush your units as you head east to Emmeryn. The group
in the west will come down and around the left side of the mountain where the
village is. The village offers a rescue staff, so you do not need to send a
significant detachment that way, maybe one or two units that can fetch it and
then regroup with the east group. Or, if they are strong enough, can get the
item, then sit in the woods at (11,22) and handle the west enemies so they
won't be a threat to Emmeryn.

When you save Emmeryn and handle the advancing enemy units, then you can
move up around the east, taking advantage of the few forts around where the
boss is. He's not too hard to deal with, but do not get careless! Be wary of
the Dark Knights all around him.

recruit Yen'fay.

A fairly enclosed map with quite a few high speed and skill enemies
(Swordmasters, Assassins, and hard hitting Heroes, as well as Tricksters).
There are no magic enemies on this map, so high defense and speed units are
recommended. A General can usually plow through pretty easily, especially
with a high defense counter and paired up with a speedy unit.

To recruit Yen'fay, speak to him with Say'ri, you will want to get to him
fairly quickly so he doesn't rush off on his own to get killed. He will come
to you if you have enemies nearby. He becomes playable right after the
conversation.

As long as your units are grouped, and have a good balance of speed and
defense, they will clear this map very easily. It becomes a steady march
north to defeat the boss after Yen'fay is secure.

E - Enemy (Will be whoever you bring on the level! If you bring less than the
           max amount [as in leave any space empty], some of your units will
           be duplicated instead)

So this chapter can be very difficult or very easy. It depends what units you
bring on it. If you bring your usual party of destroyers -- you will be
facing your own party of destroyers -- and that can be difficult!

So you can bring a bunch of weaklings instead, if you have any. If not, you
can go get some easy Spotpass people (such as Florina) and then hope they
get duplicated, and bring one or two strong people to easily sweep the floor
with them all.

Though, it may backfire and you are left with a bunch of weak ones versus your
few strong units that were cloned. Be careful!

The enemy will be aggressive, and Boss Aversa will go after ally Aversa.
Ensure Aversa survives if you want her! Let her attack herself, she should
be able to survive one attack. Have someone nearby to take the boss out
swiftly afterward. This chapter should not take long at all!

DLC CHAPTERS                                                            [DLCC]

==============================================================================

This section is for a overview of the DLC, avaliable in the in-game store.
These can be played via the Otherworld Gate on the map (Activated after
Chapter 06 in the story0. As long as the DLC is on the console, it is not
limited to any particular playthrough.

These Chapters can be replayed as many times as you like, allowing one to
grind for experience, items, etc. If you already have the character that is
recruitable, the game will give you a choice to retain your character and
their current stats, or reset them (starting anew).

The DLC usually offers either a character, or special items, or both. There
are many cameos from previous games; such as maps, characters, and music.
Conversations can be had between characters you bring with other particular
characters from previous titles.

This section is mainly under construction, as I want to prioritize the main
walkthrough first! Though if more people want the DLC to be prioritized to
know what to expect, I will focus on it.

Below is a quick highlight of DLC and their prices. The DLC title, dates,
and unlocked characters/items are listed.

The title in quotations is the English name. The one below it is the Japanese
one. The dates in the first paranthesis are the Japanese dates, the one on
the right is for the US, with price in USD.

Since they're releasing in a different order, some in map packs for the US,
I decided to bunch them by series rather than order of release.

Below is the series information with split sections!

Explanation for Basic Format!

[XXXX] The search box!

Name: Their Name

Class: Initial Class: The class they are when you get them.

When/How: How to recruit!

Other Classes: What they can become (includes both Upgrade and Class 
               Swapping)

Support: Who they can support (Anyone with * is marriable, A/S means max
         support level.)
 -Note: My Unit can support everyone so will not appear on every list to 
        avoid redundancy.
 -Note: Generation I units will be able to support whoever their children are
        up to A level, and they will not appear on the lists (instead they
        will be in "Possible children/children" lists. This is also to avoid
        clutter. In the Child's profile, possible parents will also appear
        in the same way. The same applies to siblings / non siblings.

Generation: (Generation I means Initial "parents", Generation II means child)

Children: (Who the child will be if Generation I if mother, and who the
           possible children can be if father. Exceptions exist.)
 -Note: Morgan will be anyone's son/daughter depending on 
        My Unit's gender, and will not be listed under all characters 
        aside from My Unit.
Parent: (Who the parent (mother) will be if Generation II)

Possible Children/Parent: This will be what children one can have depending
                          on relationships, and what possible parents the
                          children can have.

Base Stats: (Stats when you get them, for max stats, check Class section
             below. For information on each stat, check Vital Translatons).
 -Note: X represents growth rates, from E (bad) to A (good). These come from
        the official guide, and will be posted until proved to be mistaken
        otherwise.
 -Note: XX is the stats, not the rate.
X - Hit Points   [HP]  XX
X - Strength     [STR] XX 
X - Magic Power  [MAG] XX

X - Luck         [LUC] XX 
X - Defense      [DEF] XX 
X - Resistance   [RES] XX 
Weapon Level (S): X

Note on Stats: Max stats can vary by character and class. It would be too
complicated to write out here, so I will redirect you to a very useful
set up on serenesforest.net to view maximum stats:

http://www.serenesforest.net/fe13/char_max_all.html

Skills: The skills characters start off with will be here, for Generation I
at least. Children stats vary due to inheritance.

Birthday: Character Birthdays! Month/Day

Death Quote: What They Say when they Die

Character Bio:
(As appears on the field, if applicable)
(As appears in the Barracks)

Character Title: The Epilogue title for the character (Possibly)

Opinion: My Opinion of them (How they were as a unit, personality, etc). This
         obviously does not mean "Use or don't use" said units, as it is just
         experience in one playthrough, and the more dedicated could probably
         provide better explanations/suggestions.

         Though in the end I like to say it comes down to your own preference,
         especially in this game where one can reclass units constantly and
         max their stats out, I suppose some skills are still limited to
         certain characters, though.

         Remember: Opinion is exactly that. Like a game review, or like what
         any random person says -- do not take these as the absolute final
         word.

Epilogue Title: "High Deliverer"
Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"A traveler with no memory of the past, but a gift for tactics."
"A traveler who remembers nothing prior to being found by the wayside. Chrom
realized her/his tactical genius and enlisted her/him in the Shepherds, where
she/he is well liked. THe biggest mystery of the group."

Opinion: The character is pretty interesting in the sense that they can
support *everyone*. That is certainly unique and gives a good insight on
the character, though may also detach the player as there's no decision
making or anything involved.

In terms of classes and such, MyUnit gets to be every class of their gender
(with some exceptions), certainly making them a very malleable and
formiddable unit, likely to be one of your most superior units in the game.
Check classes and their skills, as well as growth rates to determine which
skills you want in the end to fit your character best. There is no end to
customization here.

Considering they can support *everyone*, there is obviously a lot of dialogue
that can either make you feel closer (or farther) from MyUnit. But there are
quite a few degrees of freedom in there as a result too, though it may remind
one of a dating sim, be it for good or bad.

A [LUC] 05
D [DEF] 07
E [RES] 01
Weapon Level (S): Sword (E)
Skills:
-Dual Attack+
Birthday: 5/27
Death Quote:
Epilogue Title: "Newly Exalted"
Character Bio:
"Captain of the Shepherds. Treats his men firmly but fairly."
"The prince of Ylissle and descendant of the Hero-King. While of noble blood,
he also leads a militia known as the Shepherds. His strong conviction makes
him a fine captain. The most likely to break things."

Opinion: Chrom, being one of the main characters of the game, you have to
use whether you like it or not for all non-skirmish and side missions. For
that reason, you will have to get used to him whether you like him or not!

Fortunately, he manages to hold his own on the lower difficulties right from
the start, and has the advantage of being able to use a weapon that does not
break. He has a pretty limited class set, but is able to become a Great Lord,
a very nice and well rounded class that learns Aether.

With this, if made into a Paladin, he can learn Aegis, which can go in good
combination with it.

His supports are pretty limiting too, you would expect more from the Lord of
the game, and so he doesn't actually get much room for background development
via his supports.

Skills:
-Miracle
Birthday: 3/6
Death Quote:
Epilogue Title: "Sprightly Cleric"
Character Bio:
"A Shepherd, and Chrom's little sister. Eager to prove herself."
"Chrom's tomboyish little sister, the princess of Ylissle. With nary an ounce
of nobility in her personality, she is among the most likeable and approachable
of the Shepherds. The girl most likely to snort."

Opinion: She starts off rather fragile, and continues to be as you advance
her. She has nice class options, notably Pegasus Knight and hence Dark Flier,
meaning she is capable of passing on Galeforce to her son, Owain.

Though she can be a Battle Cleric, her strength often falls short for the
point of using an axe, though the skill to get as a Battle Cleric (Renewal)
is very useful with Galeforce, and with Miracle as well. She works nicely as
a Valkyrie or Sage as an ending class, as they are magic based.

Her personality is rather up beat, though "tomboy" is not exactly the word
I would use to describe her.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"The Shepherds' stern and sarcastic second in command."
"Chrom's lieutenant, an Ylissean knight who is sincere to a fau.t He tends to
demand tremendous effort for seemingly trivial things, and prefaces such
excersises with a grin. The fondest of starting fires."

Opinion:

He will likely be your go-to guy at the start of the game, especially on
Lunatic mode where his services are especially needed. In later game, you
may find more use for him when reclassing to a lower class in order to get
him more skills and experience.

Personality wise, he's just about the most loyal person you'll find around,
as evident in his lovely support conversations, such as with Chrom.

Epilogue Title: "Archest Archer"
Character Bio:
"A grandiloquent noble with a love of tall tales and romance."
"A secretive noble from some land or another. While many would brand him a
buffoon or a braggart, his boasts are often founded. He is swift to propose
to anything female. The most prolonged primper."

Opinion: He sort of ended up mediocre for me on all my play throughs, I love
the Sniper class in previous games but they did not seem to work out this time
through, or maybe I am just terribly unlucky!

He has a variety in classes to choose from, from the more magical path to the
flying path. This means he does get a variety of skills, but you may end up
with characters that you prefer to use while Virion gets benched.

It's a shame, though, since his personality via supports is very amusing.

Character Bio:
"A no-nonsense, capable Shepherd with a mouth that would make brigands blush.
Ylissean women admire her strength and call her "The Woman to End All Men."
The last one you want cooking."

Opinion: The Red Cavalier of the game, she has fair growths but can be a
little difficult to train from the start of the game. She may start to
improve after some grinding as she has a fair choice of classes (both a
Paladin and Swordmaster, etc), meaning she has a nice range of skills that
she can learn and pass on to her child.

Her growths in Skill and Speed are better than her counterpart, Stahl. But
her Strength and Defense fall shorter.

Character Bio:
"A surprisingly normal Shepherd with a big heart and perpetual cowlick. He has
a good head on his shoulders, but the rest of him often has trouble keeping
up. The most eager to clean a plate."

Opinion: The Green Cavalier of the game. He is rather generic and uninspired,
but I think that was the point.

Like Sully, he can be difficult to train at first, he also uses a sword
instead of a lance. His growths in Strength and Defense are higher than his
counterpart Sully, but his Skill and Speed can fall shorter.

If using one, try to use the other to balance each other out.

"A rough-hewn Shepherd with a loud personality and far more confidence than
his ability warrants. He sees himself as exemplary and reverently refers to
himself in the third person. The best at misplacing things."

Opinion: "Teach" is the only fighter you get in the game, and his range of
classes are pretty good. Berserker, Warrior, and Hero are all great classes
that he can become, if you manage to train him that far.

The Warrior learns the "Counter" skill, which would pair very nicely with
Sol from a Hero, and both on a Berserker. All are very useful skills to pass
down to whoever you decide for his children to be.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"A grandiloquent but fastidious Shepherd who grows irascible if so much as
a single arrow sits ajar in its quiver. She adores research and obsesses over
her object of study. The most sueprfluous packer."

Opinion: Miriel gets balanced growths in Magic, Skill, Speed, and Luck, but
falls short in the defense category, making her a very fragile unit that
often needs protection, making her more of a liability in Lunatic mode's
earlier levels especially.

She can become a Battle Cleric and Dark Knight, but both are not recommended
as her Strength and Defense will hamper both classes, and one is better off
making her a fully magic-based unit.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"A clumsy asipring Shepherd who tries her best all the same."
"An absentminded, klutzy Shepherd with a shocking lack of self-worth. However,
she exhibits one-of-a-kind talent, particulary when it comes to working with
animals. The best at tripping over nothing."

Opinion: Sumia, the clumsy. She is a fairly well rounded unit in categories
other than magic. Her range of classes vary too, everything from the Dark
Flier to a General, neither of them really fitting to her character, but
a big boost in the skills she can learn and pass down to her daughter.

She has a surprisingly limited range of supports, and the game goes to great
lengths to say, "We're totally not trying to pair her up with Chrom" (even
titling her rescue cutscene as "lovebirds")

Her personality may get a little obnoxious.

She is one of two Pegasus Knights in the game, the other being Cordelia, who
worked out much better. However, they both have differing range of classes,
meaning a differing range of skill sets, and so it can come down to personal
preference.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"A laconic, blank-faced Shepherd whose infamous lack of presence causes him
to pass by the others as if invisible. Despite his protests, he is actually
quite proud of that. The tallest while seated."

Opinion:

Your defense man. Pairing him and Frederick together in the early game makes
for an incredible wall for the front lines. Be wary of magic around this guy,
as expected of his class.

Interesting that he can become a Thief and hence an Assassin/Trickster, as
well as a Battle Priest. This makes him open to an insane amount of useful
skills that when on a General or Great Knight, would just be deadly. A
General with Acrobat, Lethality, and Renewal for instance.

Character wise, he lacks presence, and this joke carries over quite a bit in
his support conversations. He should have been the only character with the
"Shade" or "Stillness" skill (which do not exist in this game).

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"A villager from a remote corner of Ylisse who came to the fight with little
more than farming experience. However, he is eager to learn and shows a great
deal of promise. The one with the curliest hair."

Opinion: A big complaint about Donnel is that the Villager class cannot
upgrade into anything directly. The useful thing about his base class is
learning the "Underdog" skill at Level 15. After that, he must be
changed to a different class before upgrading to a newer one.

He works out okay thanks to the extra level up opportunities he gets, but
when you train your other units diligently, it comes down to preference. If
you have time to train him, however, he becomes an incredible unit, especially
when made a Hero (personal favorite). He will likely max out most of his stats
thanks to his great growths compounded with his skills, so it comes down to
whichever class you prefer.

He has a great skill and class range, a lot of hard hitting classes with
useful skills.

You may want to consider who he passes this skill down to. He is the only
one with it in the game.

"A swordsman raised in Regna Ferox, where Khan Basilio has vouched for his
skill. While cool and curt around most people, the very sight of a woman
turns him beet red. The deftest potato peeler."

Opinion: The typical myrmidon of the game, his Skill and Speed will be
incredible while Strength and Defense may fall a little short. If given
the training he will be useful due to his range of classes avaliable, and
you may want to consider who he passes his classes down to as they are all
very useful ones with useful skills.

His personality and backstory can be somewhat interesting if looked into

Character Bio:
"A novice Shepherd who looks and acts like a child. While this endears him
to the otehrs, he hates being treated as anything less than an equal. He sees
Chrom as a brother. The most popular with cute animals."

Opinion: He has balanced growths by default, but he may be benched by the time
you get him, as you will have other useful characters to use. If you do train
him, he sometimes does incredibly well, and sometimes not so great. It can
be a manner of preference.

He has a rather limited range of classes and skills to acquire, so you may
want to consider this too when it comes to children and inheritance.

He has a few interesting support conversations, though.

"Lissa's best friend. A proud and sharp-tongued nobel from one of Ylisse's
most well-to-do houses. She is cold to strangers, particulary commoners, but
warms quickly. The most likely to toss in her sleep."

Opinion: She generally does a great job in being a magic unit, with her
magic, skill, resistance, and luck constantly on the rise. She can be a little
hard to train at first being a healer, but if oten pays off once she upgrades.
A Valkyrie is a bit better for her over a Battle Cleric as she will continue
to go up in magic and not too likely in strength.

She has access to a good range of skills, and is one of the few who can
marry Chrom. Her child, Brady, is also plain awesome. Well, as a character
anyway.

Her supports can be amusing.

"The last of the taguel race. Sensible and self-reliant."
"A nationless shape-shifter and the last of the taguel. While cool and
sensible by nature, she shows little interest in finding a partner and
remedying the fate of her race. The fastest at wolfing down a meal."

Opinion: Reminiscent of Manakete of this game and Laguz of previous games,
Panne is a manner of preference. Her growth is all over the place, getting
good growths in the physical sectors of strength, speed, defense, etc. When
you first get her in the game, access to stones are limited and so you may
have trouble training her beyond the first stone use. Her base stats without
the stone may be rather low, and so you may be best changing her to another
class first.

Her class range is fairly open, being a Thief leaves her to eventually
become an Assassin class, which may be useful. Leaving her as a Taguel is
often rare due to the limitations in weaponry, so I would advise not doing
so.

Her personality is as expected of a genocide-sole-survivor. She's not above
rabbit jokes, however. If MyUnit is paired with her, Morgan will be able
to shift into a Taguel as well.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"A formidable Ylissean thief with a soft spot for sugar."
"A cool and capable Ylissean thief who will take any job for the right price.
He is absolutely obsessed with sweets and hides 50 varieties of "emergency
snacks" in his cloak. The most frequent nosebleeder."

Opinion: The sweet thief. While his growths seem pretty balanced, he often
ends up shooting way up in Speed, sometimes with nothing else. However, it
usually catches up. He is a good doubles partner at first, as he's hard to
train individually for some time before he becomes self sufficient.

His supports can be silly. His class range is great as a Thief, and very
beneficial to whichever child he passes these classes down to.

Character Bio:
"An Ylissean pegasus knight too humble to see her vast talents."
"An Ylissean pegasus knight who has been friends with Sumia since childhood.
Her beauty, skill, and record are surpassed by few, but she cannot seem to win
Chrom's heart. The deepest, most frequent sigher."

Opinion: She worked out well for me, compared to Sumia as a Pegasus Knight.
I ultimately left her as a Hero as her final class, it seemed to work out
very well.

Her class options are pretty varied, and this will help her offspring out
too.

Her look has been very popular here (in Japan), and you can find a lot of
fan art of her to show that. It seems to be the same abroad too. Her extreme
attachment to Chrom may be off putting to some, indeed, it gets her killed,
even.

Her Birthday is also on Tanabata, that's good luck!

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"An innocent 'little' manakete with a dramatic side."
"A manakete from no land in particular. While she looks young and likes to
play outside with children, she is actually over 1,000 years old and counting.
The biggest oversleeper."

Opinion: Manaketes are a nice class, as they can attack both short and far,
like a magic user, making them superior to Taguel in a way. As such, it makes
her a pretty useful unit, but, like the Taguel, may be limited in training
due to the Dragonstone running out. This can make it difficult to grind past
a certain level, and you may want to reclass her into something like a
Wyvern Rider.

She has stable stats growth all around. But, I benched her quickly in favor
of other units.

She is also a controversial character from what I've seen, with people
uncomfortable with her child-like demeanor (in looks and personality). While
the game emphasizes the 1000 years old, it also emphasizes her immaturity. I
suppose it comes down to preference in this sense.

"An Ylissean priest with a calming mien. So lovely are his features that
strangers often mistake him for a woman. His one flaw is a tendency to get
caught up in deatils. The one with the scabbiest knees."

Opinion: The pretty-boy-priest with a dark past of the game. He comes in as
a Class 2 unit, though his base stats are subpar as expected from a pre-
promote. However, he has his uses in the sense of introducing the Battle
Monk class that can use Axes as well as heal, making him pretty useful until
you get Lissa or Maribelle up to speed.

You can eventually reclass him into another class after getting the useful
skill of Renewal.

His supports go in interesting direction, such as with Virion, as one would
expect.

Character Bio:
"A dour Plegian with a jealous streak and a knack for curses."
"A mopey Plegian dark mage with a jealous streak. She usually keeps to herself
and chants disturbing hexes but openly stalks MyUnit, in whom she has an
unhealthy interest. The one with the darkest thoughts."

Opinion: Tharja seems to be the end-all-be-all of units from skimming the
boards on gameFAQs, as well as polls in Japan according to the Knights of
Iris book, popular up there with Lucina and Cordelia, even. 

As a Dark Mage and Sorceror, her defense will be on the rise along with
her magic and speed, making her a very capable armor-killer unit, and
surprisingly weak against magic due to low resistance that comes with it.

Henry, the other dark mage, actually worked out better for me in playthroughs,
so it may come down to which Dark Mage you prefer to use.

Her personality can be creepy, but it seems her attachment to MyUnit and
rather odd nature makes her oddly popular. It makes you wonder about the
audience...

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"An enigmatic merchant with a bevy of identical sisters --more than she can
count. Like most merchants, she is a smooth talker who loves both gold and
rich customers. The one with the fattest nest egg."

Opinion: Anna is a very useful unit when you first get her, and she ends with
incredible luck. However, if you don't continue to use her from when you first
get her, she will likely start to fall behind as prepromotes generally do.
Her stats in some areas are subpar, but her ability to use staves and swords
can come in handy.

I advise reclassing her after she learns the very useful skill "Acrobat."
Another downside is her support is very limited to MyUnit and Tiki, meaning
she won't receieve the same benefits as other units with plenty of supports
may. For these reasons she may fall behind in the later game.

Her other classes can be useful, but Trickster/Assassin may be the best for
her.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"A shy, introverted caravan dancer who goes above and beyond to help others.
Despite her stage fright, she is unparalleled in her craft and has admirers
around the world. The most mesmerizing singer."

Opinion: She's the only dancer you get in this game! She's a very useful unit,
but initially very weak, so you have to do your best to defend her. Luckily
she's easy to level up since the dancing gives experience! She will do really
nicely in the luck and speed category, so will often be able to dodge in those
vital moments.

Eventually I made her an Assassin, and a Swordmaster, then back to Dancer.
That way, she was able to not only dance, but also defend herself by using
the skills Astra or Lethality, etc.

The overly shy personality may get annoying for some, but to those it was
aiming to appeal to here (in Japan), it certainly worked! She is still a good
unit for support regardless of that.

She is the hardest to pair with Chrom, as you have to make sure every other
compatible female unit is married off.

Character Bio:
"A wyvern rider in the service of House Virion. She was raised with simple
values and likes to cook and sew, but loves her "sweet, adorable" wyvern
Minerva even more. The most terrifying when angry."

Opinion: The first and one of the only Wyvern Riders you get, she has all
the strengths that come with it, such as Strength, Skill, and Defense. She
can be a fairly good unit if you keep training her. Cordelia and Sumia you
would have had plenty of time to train before you get her, so you can take
your pick on preference regarding a flying unit.

She can become a Battle Cleric to get the useful skill Renewal, but ultimately
left as Wyvern Lord may be best. Besides, it would be awkward for her to
constantly mention Minerva when Minerva doesn't exist. (Or if she's riding
a Griffon instead...?)

Tiki actually worked out as an overall better Wyvern Lord, but you get her
much later in the game.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"A Plegian dark mage with a fetish for bloodshed and an indelible grin.
While disarmingly optimistic, he shows a gruesome lack of mercy while on the
battlefield. The one with the lowest heart rate."

Opinion: If the above description didn't describe this creepy character
enough, his support conversations will say enough. Though, he's so creepy it's
charming, with his lovely jokes and all.

Like Tharja, his defense will continue to increase well if you make him into
a Sorceror. His class set allows him to learn good skills, such as Counter
and Lethality, as well as Acrobat, which may benefit a Sorceror in the end
quite a bit.

He worked out better than Tharja for me, but it is a manner of personal
preference when it comes down to that, as they are both pretty similar.

His eternal happiness is pretty adorable. His supports can also be very...
interesting. Both with Sumia, and with Ricken, he's full of amusement.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"Chrom's future daugher, a kind and just princess who made it her duty to
save the world. She loves her fatehr and would do anything to keep him safe.
The least likely to get a joke."

Opinion: She was probably my overall most successful unit, with the best 
performence overall. MyUnit had married Chrom, and so she had inherited
every avaliable Female class, and so could acquire any skill of those classes
if changed and trained to the required levels.

Considering she had already started with Aether among other things, as well
as the ability to support my other most often used units (i.e. MyUnit, Krom,
Wood, Mark (who was a sibling), etc, and then paired with the fact she also
gets an infinite weapon all came down to her being an incredible unit during
my playthrough. I settled on Great Lord in the end as I liked the model
best, and the well rounded stats, over the other classes she could be.

I also like her design, a bit less on the fanservice side. She was voted
quite the popular character in Japan in polls from The Knights of Iris. I'm
not sure how she compares in the west, so far I have seen more favor on other
characters.

In terms of personality, she's quite the loyal one, with a strong exterior and
a softer interior. Some with a degree of understanding of Japanese (and even
those without) may get tired of her saying Otou-sama (My Lord-father),
a lot, or Okaa-sama (My Lord-Mother) a lot, but I forgave her for it
when you understand the circumstance of where she's coming from (that is, a
world where everyone's parents are dead).

Being her parent makes a few events in the story also seem more relevant,
such as the confrontation scene.

Trivia: Her birthday is the same as the release of the first Fire Emblem
game.

Character Bio:
"The upright and dignified princess of the Chon'sin dynasty. Her old-fashioned

Yen'fay fiercely. The most talented skin diver."

Opinion: She is one of the last few characters you get in the game, especially
if you do all the child sidequests before going to meet her, which is
possible and highly likely. If you did so, you likely also have units that
are already better than her in everyway. She is a fairly well rounded unit
though if you bother to train her.

Her personality is pretty fair, and design that of which the female
swordmaster character model is based off in this game.

She remains story relevant, but can only support MyUnit and Tiki, making her
pretty limited to bonuses she can receive from relationships.

Character Bio:
"The Voice of the divine dragon. While mature, she also has a child-like
side. Being a dragonkin, she has lived since days of yore and was friends
with the Hero-King, Marth. The most likely to sleep in."

Opinion: A cameo from the older games, just a little more grown up. She comes
a little latish in the game, but if you like to grind in skirmishes to bring
people up to speed, she will probably work nicely! But at this point I imagine
you would already have a select group of powerful units that may end up
benching Tiki anyway. It all just comes down to how you play! She starts off
with the Dragonstone+ though, which boosts her stats incredibly while she
uses it.

Her HP and Luck will go up almost guaranteed, the rest of her stats often
follow for overall good level ups.

Though her story presence is off and on, she's still able to die and remain
dead for the epilogue.

I reclassed her into a Wyvern Rider when she maxed out her Manakete level,
and she did okay there too, but not as good as my already existing flying
units. So it comes down to your preference and patience, really! When she
upgraded into a Wyvern Lord from there, she did extremely well; again, it
depends how much you grind/would use her in late game.

Due to design, she's really popular here (in Japan) as you can imagine! She
has quite a bit of fan art of her as well that you can easily find on places
like pixiv! Personality wise, despite the exterior can still be a little
childish. The supports with the female MyUnit is pretty silly.

Character Bio:
"The West-Khan of Regna Ferox. His rival, Flavia, calls him "oaf" due to his
attitude, but he is actually quite quick witted. He exhibits a fatherly side
around Chrom's group. The guy with the biggest reactions."

Opinion: His story presence is great, but by the time you get him as a
playable character, the average party and equivalent level of Warrior may
be doing much better than him. He has good HP and attack going for him,
but his speed and defense start to lag behind what others you may have.

You get him on the third last chapter of the game, so storywise he may not
be too useful, but if messing around with skirmishes and such before the
last level, you may find some use!

Personally, I think his funky clothing is awesome, and seems to have set the
standard for the warrior model, which may look awkward on other characters

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"The East-Khan and current ruler of Regna Ferox. She has a swagger about her
and dislikes formalities, but nonetheless looks after her own. Basilio is her
rival and best friend. The first to push for push-ups."

Opinion: I love the Hero class! Especially when a female hero pops around now
and then. Unfortunately she falls behind a bit compared to other Heroes/units
you may have by Chapter 23. At Level 10 as a Hero one's average stats would
be better.

Her design is okay I think! Certainly unique for a Fire Emblem game! I haven't
heard much about her from my friends who play and love this game, and have not
seen much work of her online, so I assume she may not be as popular here.
Perhaps if/when the game is released overseas? (Update: Nope, not really!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generation II

-Note: Section still in progress.
-Note: MyUnit can still form relationships with everyone in this generation,
       but relationships will only produce Morgan.
-Note: All Generation II units will have A supports with their mother, and
       A supports with whoever their father is. As such, all possible
       fathers are not listed at the moment.
-Note: Alternate classes (the ones that they don't start off as) are inherited
       from the parent's alternate classes. MyUnit's children will have all
       classes avaliable to that gender unlocked. For now, the sections do
       not contain all possible classes from all fathers. Check father's
       class options to determine what the child will have in addition of
       what they inherit from their mother (already shown).
-Note: Skills are passed down from parents
-Note: Base stats and growths and such vary greatly pending on parents!
-Note: Sidequests unlock the moment an S rank is reached with the parents,
       and if the story is after Chapter 13.
-Note: Children can usually be recruited by their Mothers or Krom, but
       exceptions are noted, such as Nah.
-Note: Morgan, Lucina have varying supports; For Example: If you are Lucina's
       parent, there will be a separate branch of supports than if you were
       not. Mark likewise, if related to a character, will have a different
       branch of supports. If Chrom marries another female aside from MyUnit,
       that child will be related to Lucina, etc.
-Note: Generation II can marry (with no children with the exception of
       (MyUnit/Avatar), but cannot marry with those who may be siblings (such
       as if Chrom marries Olivia, then Inigo cannot be with Lucina).

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"Chrom's future daugher, a kind and just princess who made it her duty to
save the world. She loves her fatehr and would do anything to keep him safe.
The least likely to get a joke."

Opinion: She was probably my overall most successful unit, with the best 
performence overall. MyUnit had married Chrom, and so she had inherited
every avaliable Female class, and so could acquire any skill of those classes
if changed and trained to the required levels.

Considering she had already started with Aether among other things, as well
as the ability to support my other most often used units (i.e. MyUnit, Krom,
Wood, Mark (who was a sibling), etc, and then paired with the fact she also
gets an infinite weapon all came down to her being an incredible unit during
my playthrough. I settled on Great Lord in the end as I liked the model
best, and the well rounded stats, over the other classes she could be.

I also like her design, a bit less on the fanservice side. She was voted
quite the popular character in Japan in polls from The Knights of Iris. I'm
not sure how she compares in the west, so far I have seen more favor on other
characters.

In terms of personality, she's quite the loyal one, with a strong exterior and
a softer interior. Some with a degree of understanding of Japanese (and even
those without) may get tired of her saying Otou-sama (My Lord-father),
a lot, or Okaa-sama (My Lord-Mother) a lot, but I forgave her for it
when you understand the circumstance of where she's coming from (that is, a
world where everyone's parents are dead).

Being her parent makes a few events in the story also seem more relevant,
such as the confrontation scene.

Trivia: Her birthday is the same as the release of the first Fire Emblem
game, and FE9: Path of Radiance.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"Lissa's future son. His elaborate theatrics suggest a need to stand out, as
do the absurd names he bestows upon his weapons and his "special moves." The
most apt to shout "Level up!"

Opinion: Owain worked out really well for me! His father was Lon'qu the first
time around, and so he had a few nice options avaliable to him. He eventually
replaced Lon'qu on my team despite coming in relatively later in the game.

(Though Lon'qu was a pretty class limiting-idea in retrospect, so if you want
variety, try somebody else with a completely different class set!)

His supports were interesting as is his overall character, it's curious how
he can marry Lucina when they are cousins by default, but I guess only
immediate relation (siblings/parents) matter.

His yelling of previous game names is also endearing. Radiant Dawn! Sacred
Stones! Binding Blade! As well as his reference to other Fire Emblem
characters, (By the red of Eliwood's hair! Great Nephenee's Lance! Etc)

He can inherit useful skills from Lissa alone, so pairing with an equally
variable father will allow him to do incredibly well.

"Olivia's future son. A friendly young man with an insatiable love for
women. However, the ladies see his flirting as shallow and seldom bite. He
secretly wants to be a dancer. The biggest night owl."

Opinion: Inigo has the potential to be the Hero class, which already made
me like him! The problem was though the Heroes I had by the time I got him
were already doing really well as they were, and so Azure got benched pretty
early for me.

Though, the variety in his classes are great. The father can take this even
further. He can also potentially inherit Galeforce, among other skills.

His personality is quite flowery indeed.

Death Quote: "Ha... in the end... I'm just baggage... No help... to anyone..."
Character Bio:
"Maribelle's future son. While he looks terrifying, he is more likely to burst
into tears than bust out a weapon. The scar on his face is from a stray violin
string. The most likely to incur friendly fire."

Opinion: Poor Brady, he's pretty self loathing, and a lot of people seem to
agree with his self loathing. I personally liked his character quite a bit!
He also works out as a balanced unit, upgrading into a Battle Monk yielded
useful results, and the skill of Renewal, which taken to other classes can
help quite a bit.

As with healers, you may have to be patient to train him first, but it becomes
rather steady after that. You get him at Level 10, so can actually promote
him right off, which I recommend, to allow him to gain combat experience as
a Battle Monk. Pending on the father, you can get him some useful classes.

He can also be Chrom's son/Lucina's brother, that's something, right?

Character Bio:
"Sully's future daughter, a model of chivalry. She believes the strong must
protect the weak and loves to better herself through sport, but is reckless
about who she challenges. The most attached to her armor."

Opinion: Kjelle has a hit or miss personality with some. As a unit, she also
has a hit or miss preference. She can have a pretty limited range of classes
if the right father isn't chosen, as many can become Cavaliers and Knights,
just like her mother.

She gets a good deal of luck, and naturally will increase in defense if
left in the same class. You may have better units though, and she often ends
up getting benched.

slips up more often than not. The most baffling sleep talker."

Opinion: Her personality can be obnoxious as well, and she seems to inherit
some of Sumia's annoying traits as well.

As a unit, she can be decent in terms of her Luck status, which seems to
be common among the second generation. She can upgrade into magic classes,
though her magic is pretty terrible by default. She can inherit useful skills
from her mother, and can also be one of Chrom's children.

Birthday: 1/21
Death Quote: "I couldn't do it, Mother... I'm sorry..."
Character Bio:
"Cordelia's future daughter. Growing up in the shadow of her mother has given
her an inferiority complex and an attitude to match. She likes using words to
get her way. The most wasteful shopper."

Opinion: As a unit she worked really nicely for me! Her default class swapping
options regardless of the father enable you to get quite the nice skill set.

I ulitimately left her as an Assassin, but made sure she got some of the 
useful skills from the other classes. She worked nicely as an Assassin, with 
the high skill stat, and when you have Lethality with Galeforce (which she 
can either inherit or learn on her own), she becomes incredibly useful.

Pending on the father, you can compound onto that skill set to make quite the
able Hero or whatever class you choose.

Personality wise she may not be the nicest to talk to, but I believe the
"tsundere"-ish character is appealing to many the game is geared toward. She
shares a love-hate relationship with most with deep seated mommy-issues as
the game itself describes. 

Her relationship with characters if often the same sort of relationship fans
of older Fire Emblem games (and myself) share with this game...

Character Bio:
"MyUnit's future son/daughter. An upbeat boy/girl who remembers little about
the future--not even which future he/she came from. He/she wants to be a
tactician like his/her mother/father. The most shamelessly self driven."

Opinion: One of the most useful units! Considering no matter what they will
be able to be any class thanks to one of the parents always being MyUnit.

Morgan was great at boosting other weaker characters by Doubling with them
to enable them to level up and come up to speed with the rest of the team
when recruited late in the game. 

His/her birthday is on Children's Day in Japan! That makes sense, right?

A little on the bland side as a character an in design, I suppose, being the
opposite gender though, paired with MyUnit, gives you access to all gender
exclusive classes if both are utlized (though with the exception of the
special classes, of course). I am not sure if personality varies between
the two genders yet (I've only had the male Mark so far, will update when
the female one comes around).

The female one can be a special class, such as Manakete or Taguel depending
on the mother --however, still cannot be a Dancer as two Dancers would cause
issues with being able to move constantly...

Character Bio:
"Panne's future son. Terrified that his race (i.e., himself) will go extinct,
he has become a colossal coward--but he might put himself out on a limb for a
comrade's sake. The loudest talker."

Opinion: His cowardly personality and preservation of his race is endearing.
However, it may make one uncomfortable when he is with his mother constantly
talking about preservation and the two being potentially the last male and
female...

Like with Panne, he may be better off switching to another class early, though
the difference is Beaststones should be readily avaliable by the time you get
him, making him easier to train as a Taguel than for his mother. He will
inherit useful classes from her, and can be a useful unit pending on the
father.

Ultimately, though, I did not use him too much.

Trivia: His birthday is the same as the release of FE2: Gaiden.

Weapon Level (S): Magic (C)
Birthday: 4/25
Character Bio:
"Miriel's future son. A sharp but overserious wunderkind. Folks take advantage
of his wisdom and empathy, but his attention to detail makes him a natural
problem solver. The one with the worst lens glare."

Opinion: Laurent is very hit or miss -- and has always been miss with me it
seems. His range of default classes has Warrior, which can be useful for
the skills, but his strength growth may hinder this path.

His supports are very similar to his mother, go figure. It comes down to
personal preference for this one.

Trivia: His birthday is the same as the release of FE7: Blazing Sword.

Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"Tharja's future daughter. Repeated doses of her mother's hexes turned her
into an extreme coward and pessimist --but beware her terrifying alter ego
when pushed too far. The first to flee when danger hits."

Opinion: The guinea pig of Tharja. She can be prettty useful, her speed
generally tends to shoot way up, making her quite the speedy unit. While
her default class set has the useful Sorceror, pending on the father, she
can perform really well.

Her personality has interesting...twists.

Trivia: Her birthday is the same as the release of FE8: Sacred Stones.

[NAHH]

Class: Lv 10 Manakete -&gt; None
When/How:
 -S Support Nowi with anyone compatible, complete Chapter 13

C [DEF] 03
C [RES] 03
Weapon Level (S): None
Birthday: 3/29
Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"Nowi's future daughter. Unlike her mother, she is remarkably grown up and
keeps her feelings in check--especially about her weird name. She has a knack
for reading people. The one with the nicest teeth."

Opinion: The level she is recruited on is one of the harder ones. She is
one of the few who can support Tiki as well.

She can be a useful Manakete, and will often perform better than her mother
when trained to do so, but if not training her, then you may have better
units by this point in the game anyway.

Her father is important as it will open new class options to her, so one may
want to think on who to pair Nowi with in order to better Nah.

Trivia: Her birthday is the same as the release of FE6: Sword of Seals.

[GANG]

Name: Gangrel
Class:  Lv 15 Trickster
When/How: SpotPass Content; Sidequest 18; Enemy (X 11, Y 14); Talk with Chrom

D [LUC] 15
D [DEF] 18
D [RES] 17
Weapon Level (S): Sword (B) Staff (C)
Birthday: 3/16
Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"The wild and ruthless former king of Plegia. He once took sick pleasure in
hurting others, but his own life was not easy, and he has shown signs of
reform since joining Chrom. The most hopeless acrophobe."

Opinion: Very interesting that he's just up and about without anyone caring,
but for the sake of gameplay, here he is. Also nothing in the supports about
his plot and...never mind.

He's a pretty good unit, and has quite the range of useful classes he can
become, and hence useful skills. He can only support MyUnit, and Morgan can
have a very interesting father as a result...

However, like with other Bonus Box characters, you get him in the "post game,"
pretty much, making him not too useful for actual story missions.

[WALH]

Name: Walhart / Vaalhart
Class: Lv 30 Overlord
When/How: SpotPass Content; Sidequest 19; Enemy; Fight with Krom, Defeat, End
          of Level

C [DEF] 35
D [RES] 19
Weapon Level (S): Sword (A), Lance (A), Axe (A)
Birthday: 9/14
Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"The unforgiving man who forged the Valmese Empire. He loathes losers and
cowards and sought to unite the world through absolute power. (He's calmed
down since. ...A bit.) The most devout vegetarian."

Opinion: The Conqueror is back. Somehow, since Chrom has this bad habit of not
putting down his opponents.

He is an amazing unit, as you can see, with his unique class and skill that
comes with it. He will be good no matter what class you put him in, with
his max weapon skills and very useful Conqueror skill.

You get him right after the last level, though, making him pretty much a
"post game" unit, so may not have any actual uses for the main campaign.

[EMME]

Name: Emmeryn / Emerina
Class: Lv 10 Sage
When/How: SpotPass Content; Sidequest 20; NPC, Protect / Talk with Chrom /
          Lissa
Other Classes:
 -Cleric -&gt; Battle Cleric / Sage
 -Cavalier -&gt; Paladin / Great Knight

Base Stats:

B [MAG] 26
C [SKL] 23
C [SPD] 25
A [LUC] 13
D [DEF] 12
D [RES] 20
Weapon Level (S): Tomes (C) Staff (A)
Birthday: 12/23
Death Quote:
Character Bio:
"Chrom's elder sister, the former exalt of Ylisse. A fall in Plegia took most
of her memory and impaired her speech, but the love in her heart could not be
diminished. The hardest to kill."

Opinion: It seems nobody remains dead in this game... it sort of trivializes 
the whole point of... well you get the point!

Her class selection is fairly limited, and covers a range of skills that may
be useful if ending as a Sage, but nothing substantial. You get her incredibly
late due to being a Bonus Box paralogue, and hence right at the end of the
game. Her start stats are probably lower than any other magic user you would
have by this point.

She's only able to support MyUnit, not even Chrom or Lissa, a little odd on
the developers' part.

[YENF]

Name: Yen'fay / Renha
Class: Lv 20 Swordmaster
When/How: SpotPass Content; Sidequest 21; NPC, Talk with Say'ri
Other Classes:
 -Myrmidon -&gt; Swordmaster / Assassin
 -Archer -&gt; Sniper / Bow Knight
 -Wyvern Rider -&gt; Wyvern Lord / Griffon Rider
Support: None
Generation: I
Children: None

C [SKL] 43
C [SPD] 45
B [LUC] 32
D [DEF] 23
E [RES] 20
Weapon Level (S): Sword (A)
Birthday: 7/23
Character Bio:
"The former Chon'sin dynast, but not the Yen'fay who died in the volcano;
like Lucina, he hails from the future. Earnest and meditative to a fault,
he longs to protect his sister Say'ri. The best under high temperatures."

Opinion:

The game makes fun of itself with how people don't stay dead on the chapter
you get Yen'fay.

Like the other units you get via Bonus Box, you probably already have other
units of his class that have far surpassed him in everyway. He has fair
luck and HP growth, and looks pretty cool aesthetically, but that's all
he has going for him...

[AVER]

Name: Aversa / Inverse
Class: Lv 20 Dark Flier
When/How: SpotPass Content; Side Chapter 22, Ensure she fights herself and
          survives the level
Other Classes:
 -Pegasus Knight -&gt; Falcon Knight / Dark Pegasus
 -Dracoknight -&gt; Dragonmaster / Griffon Knight

Skills:
-Speed + 2
-Relief
-Shadowgift
-Rally Movement
-Galeforce
Weapon Level (S): Lance (B) Tome (A)
Birthday: 11/03
Character Bio:
"A cunning vixen who once served Validar faithfully and leveraged her "assets"
to lead men to their ruin. She has sought to atone since learning Validar
manipulated her. The fondest of taking long swims."

Opinion:

She comes with pretty nice skills, and has an okay class set as well. Like the
other late comers via sidequests and bonus boxes, a good unit, but you probably
have better units by now.

With limited supports, she loses out on bonuses that others may have on the
field.

Personality wise, well everything in the story was a lie, and she gives you
a quick tragic backstory that doesn't really convince anyone. I'm sure some
are fond of the seductive sort of person, though. Her design looks all over
the place.

        will not be listed as "Can" in every section).
 -Note: Morgan can also be any class due to being MyUnit's son/daughter.
        Morgan can be a special class IF the daughter of characters of a
        special class. (Daughter due to male being able to pick a mate).

[MSLD]

(Note: Left side of the "/": Male, Right side of the "/": Female)
Weapons: Sword, Lance
Who: None
Who can:
-Chrom
-Lucina

Class Opinion: A great class to default upgrade to, especially with the well
rounded stats and exclusivity to just two characters! The skill Aether is
also really useful, both restoring HP and likely KOing the enemy. The fact
that Lucina and Krom also get an infinite weapon (A sword that doesn't
break) really helps this class out too for the both of them. I recommend
after you have given them whichever skills you want, you put them back to
this class.

There is no story limitation as there usually is with Lords in other games,
either! So you can upgrade Krom at any point if he is above Level 10 and
you have the right item.

If Lucina is MyUnit's child, then you can allocate even more of other class's
skills to this one!

[STRT]

Class Name: Tactician
Class Type: I
Promotes To: Grandmaster
Movement: 5; Type: Normal
Double Effects: Strength + 1, Magic + 1, Skill + 2, Speed + 2
Natural Skills:
-Lv 01: Veteran
-Lv 10: Solidarity
Stats: Min.   Max. Growth Rates
  [HP]  16     60       C
  [STR] 04     25       C          
  [MAG] 03     25       C          
  [SKL] 05     25       C         
  [SPD] 05     25       C          
  [LUC] 00     30       E          
  [DEF] 05     25       D          
  [RES] 03     25       D          
Weapons: Sword, Tomes
Who:
-Avatar / MyUnit
Who can:
-Morgan

Class Opinion: An incredibly well balanced class! It's also exclusive to
MyUnit, however, any others you meet via SpotPass or StreetPass also can be
any class and this as a default.

The Veteran skill is very useful too, in terms of giving you a lot
of experience!

[GMAS]

Class Name: Grandmaster
Class Type: II
Promotes From: Tactician
Movement: 6 ; Type: Normal
Double Effects: Strength + 2, Magic + 2, Skill + 2, Speed + 2
Natural Skills:
-Lv 05: Ignis
-Lv 15: Rally Spectrum
Stats: Min.   Max. Growth Rates
  [HP]  20     80       C
  [STR] 07     40       C          
  [MAG] 06     40       C          
  [SKL] 07     40       C

  [DEF] 07     40       D          
  [RES] 05     40       D          
Weapons: Sword, Tomes
Who:
-None
Who can:
-Avatar / My Unit
-Morgan
Description: "A seasoned tactician upon whom victory hinges."

Class Opinion: Just like the Tactician before it, this class has great
balance when maxed! I believe the MyUnit upside/downside in stat will effect
the maximum slightly for some stats, but should generally be around the
same otherwise!

The skill Rally Cry is a very useful command function too, and so is worth
getting on your MyUnit before possibly changing for sure!

[CAVA]

Class Name: Cavalier
Class Type: I
Promotes To:
 -Paladin
 -Great Knight

very reliable class otherwise.

Class Opinion: A lot of characters can become Myrmidons, and the most useful
aspect (for me) is the fact they get the skill Vantage, and can go on to
become Assassins and Swordmasters, both excellent classes in their own
regards with more useful skills too! If changing to a Myrmidon or if you
have a Myrmidon, be sure to take advantage of the access to these skills!

Class Opinion: A very skillfull and speedy class that makes for a great
support unit! They're naturally hard to hit too, assuming you promoted from
a Myrmidon! Later on though, the maximum stats start to fall short when up
against heaviny protected enemies, you'll attack quickly but likely do no
damage due to the low strength, unfortunately...

Otherwise, the skill Astra is very useful to have, as well as the boost
in Skill and Speed growth for those who need it!

 -Vaike
 -Kellam
 -Panne
 -Anna
 -Henry
 -Flavia
 -Yarne
 -Gangrel

Class Opinion: A quick and hard hitting unit! The Assassin class sacrifices
defense and resistance for skill, speed, and the ability to kill someone
in one hit! A lot of characters can become this class, and it's a good idea
to get both Lethality and Pass before possibly changing over again, both
are incredibly useful skills.

Like the Swordmaster, the strength may fall short against later enemies, but
should not pose as much as a problem.

In just looks alone, I think they look pretty cool! Both male and female.

Class Opinion: I tend to have this love for Heroees that likely leads to me
changing the above to Mercenaries when able, but the Mercenary class itself
is a well rounded one, more toward strength than resistance. The skills
acquired are fairly useful as well. The real reward comes from the class they
upgrade into, being Hero.

Class Opinion: A very well balanced unit which falls a bit behind in the
magic category, but has decent resistance for a physical unit. The attack
power mixed with the skill and defense makes for a deadly unit. The speed
may fall behind a little, but is still fairly high relatively.

Their skills allow for HP recovery as well as death to any Axe user that may
be around.

They are my personal favorite class! Though I was a little off-set by the
male model that has an odd sort of neck brace, the female one came out
nice, I thought at least!

Class Opinion: This class is male only, as much as I was looking forward to
the possibility of a Female Fighter/Warrior! Anyway, they are solely strength
reliant, so magic and resistance will take a huge hit. Their HP, attack,
and defense will make up for it, and the speed varies.

I have not really been a fan of the Fighter class in any Fire Emblem game;
however, Warriors are often worth it!

Class Opinion: Warriors are a pretty useful class. It's a shame they are a
male only class though, a Female Warrior would have been interesting!

Anyway, at maximum strength this class is quite the powerhouse, the fact
they can also use Bows adds to this, making them a deadly ranged and melee
unit. Resistance and magic remain low, so just keep away from too many
magical encounters, though they will likely kill the magician if they attack
first. Maybe mixing it up with Vantage if possible would be useful when in
danger!

Also, the skill Counter makes for a very nice defensive enemy HP reducing
move! So for those who can become warriors, it may be a useful skill to get
and pass down to children too.

Class Opinion: Another male only class, though a Female Barbarian would be
very interesting to see in concept alone!

There is no natural one you get, so you have to change classes in order to
have a Barbarian. You fight them quite often in the earlier chapters, though.

Not the greatest or best units, they upgrade into the deadly Berserkers, so
are worth the training. The skills are not particulary noteworthy, but they
are unique.

Class Opinion: This is a good class. The strength is massive, along with
good speed, they are good at cutting through units with high defense.
The issue comes in with low resistance and defense, it would be a good idea
to ensure you initiate fights that you know you will be able to win rather
than stranding them on a field full of magic users though!

It is a Male only class, how interesting a female one would be.

 -Anna
 -Lucina
 -Emmeryn
 -Yen'fay

Class Opinion: Your basic ranged unit, they are the only class that can go
on to become Snipers though, which are a very useful ranged unit! The learned
Archer skills also allow you to have a bonus for attacking first, if mixed
with the Mercenary ability, then you can have bonuses no mater who attacks
first.

Class Opinion: A skillful ranged physical unit, they usually perform really
well for me. A good amount of units can become Archers! Though compared to
the skills of Snipers in some previous Fire Emblem games, these skills seem
lacking!

Class Opinion: A nice support unit! The fact they can use both swords and
staves at the same time makes them pretty useful on the field. Later on,
they strength and magic may lag behind a little, but their skills may be
useful to have for characters who can change over to this class and then
on to something else.

The movement + 1 really helps when doubled up too!

Class Opinion: A quick and effective class for long ranged movements and
mage killing. They start to fall short in stength and defense, but it is
made up for in speed, skill, resistance, and movement. Beware of those
Archers, though, they're excellent at clipping their wings.

A female only class, which makes several very useful skills gained by
upgrading the class limited to them. I would have loved to see a male
Pegasus knight, too!

They are also able to upgrade into the Dark Flier, which gains the famed
skill Galeforce at Level 15, a useful asset for any unit.

  [RES] 00     20       D          
Weapons: Lance
Who: Donnel

Class Opinion: The best thing about this class would simply be to get the
two exclusive skills, then to change to another class.

Maxing our his stats minus HP may help too.

[DNCE]

Class Name: Dancer
Class Type: Special
Movement: 5 ; Type: Normal
Double Effects: Speed + 3, Luck + 3
Natural Skills:
-Lv 01: Luck +4

  [RES] 01     30       D          
Weapons: Sword
Special Move: Dance (Allows character who is danced for move again)
Who: Olivia

Class Opinion: The Dancer class is really useful, allowing you to move again.
While the stats caps are a lot lower than a lot of other classes, you can
change your dancer to another class to gain skills from other classees, then
shift back to hopefully make your Dancer better on the defensive so you can
move someone twice and protect yourself.

[TAGU]

Class Name: Taguel
Class Type: Special
Movement: 6 ; Type: Beast
Double Effects: Strength + 3, Skill + 2, Speed + 3

  [RES] 01/02  30/30       D/D          
(Note: Left side of the "/": Male, Right side of the "/": Female)
Weapons: None (Uses Stones)
Who:
 -Panne
 -Yarne

Class Opinion: I have a human bias, as I did not utilize the Laguz much in
the Fire Emblem 9 and 10. However, they did prove to be useful when doubled
with another unit for support purposes.

They are better off switching to another class in the long run.

[MANA]

Class Name: Manakete
Class Type: Special
Movement: 6 ; Type: Dragon
Double Effects: Strength + 2, Magic + 2, Defense + 2, Resistance + 2
Natural Skills:
-Lv 01: Odd Biorhythm

Stats: Min.   Max. Growth Rates

  [RES] 02     40       C          
Weapons: None (Uses Stones)
Who:
 -Nowi
 -Tiki
 -Nah

Class Opinion: Like with the Taguel, I did not utilize the Manakete as much
as I could have. They did prove to be good support units, though. All can
change into Dragon-riding warriors too, which is interesting.

EXTRAS                                                                  [EXTR]
==============================================================================

This section will detail the various Extras in the game.

SpotPass Content:

This is just a reference to all the things avaliable in the Bonus Box (found
within the "Wireless" menu).

You may have to do "Update Now" in order to see below.

This is current as of 4/18/13.

Bonus Teams:

These are spotpass teams from previous games. All team leaders can be
recruited, as well as fought as many times as you want. The teams are built
up in ways sometimes familiar with players of previous games.

An example is Nino's team from FE7, she's with a Hero, Swordmaster, and
Assassin, which could represent Linus, Lloyd, and Jaffar, for instance. Or
Lyn's crew being the characters you get in Lyn's story, or Nergal's team the
Black Fang. Fun little references like that.

I will not include their skills/stats as you can view them yourself, and
it will make the list cleaner this way.

Note that the characters often will have special skills and stats, though.

SUPPORT ARCHIVE                                                         [SPPT]
==============================================================================

Unlike previous FIre Emblem games, supports in this work in a slightly
different way.

There is no maximum limit of 5 supports per play through, the only limitation
is one "S" support (marriage), but the rest can be filled up.

Rather than the amount of turns that pass with units next to each other, or
the amount of times units appear on the same map together, in this the
supports come about as a result of the relationship status (the hearts that
appear above the heads of units next to each other).

Seed of Trust, Event Tiles, and conversations in the barracks also help
relationships improve. Supports boost supporting units' stats when fighting
together or near each other.

They also lead to special epilogues if married. Whether these epilogues will
be listed below is up to the readers. Maybe they should in character profiles
instead?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIST OF SUPPORTS

Note: MyUnit supports *everyone*, and can marry *anyone* of the opposite
      gender, including Generation II units.
Note: MyUnit's support conversations are sometimes the same for both male
      and female, or very similar. S ranks differ, however.
Note: Children supports' with their fathers are often the same. The only
      things that vary are the father's lines/responses, but the children
      will have the same lines most of the time. Sometimes even the responses
      are *exactly* the same. (For instance, Inigo being Chrom's son will
      have almost the *exact* conversation as if Inigo were, say, Libra's
      son). The compilation may support this.
Note: Sibling supports' are often similar situations, with some variations
      in dialogue. (For instance; Lucina and Inigo as siblings have the
      same situation as Lucina and Morgan (Male) as siblings; just with some
      very small differences).

Tips for 100% Completing the Support Archive:
-Preferrably second playthrough to already have the archive and keep track
 of what supports you do and do not have.
-Play either Casual mode, or make sure another save file is open if playing
 Classic.
-Make a save file that has all A supports but no S's. Preferrably one before
 Chapter 13 (where Chrom is forced to marry).
-Now, get S supports with different parirings, but do NOT save on the same
 file, instead, save on a spare file. (IF casual mode, then on-map "Save" will
 work.)
-Reload the original file, get S supports with different pairings, and repeat
 the above process.
-In the Support Archive, all those S supports should be recorded!
-If you have Seeds of Trust, then you can keep using them, get the supports,
 save on a separate file, then redo this method for different pairs. This is
 much quicker then building it up manually, try to have at least 4 in stock.

Note: The issue with the above method is that the second generation has
      special supports depending on the parents --these are the ones that will
      be harded to get as a result, but you can continue from that save file
      and mix up pairings to ensure you don't have to keep playing through
      from the first chapter to get all the different parirings.

Heart!

ENDINGS

This is where endings, individual/married will be posted. This section will
likely take long times to update too due to the variety and possiblities,
though I will seek help to ensure it is completed faster, if ever.

Note: Like with supports, many endings follow a pattern and are often the
      same. The father usually has a set epilogue, and the wife's story will
      vary.
Note: MyUnit has the same epilogue depending on gender, regardless of who the
      wife or husband is (with a few exceptions).

==============================================================================

This section will contain strategies and tips for use in general! There will
be small other things like terrain bonuses and things like that too!

Event Tiles ------------------------------------------------------------------

As serenesforest calls them, these are the sparkling gold tiles on the map.

You can get various rewards by waiting on them. If doubled and capable of
supporting, a unit's relationship may improve.

Otherwise, you may get EXP, or weapon EXP.

Lastly, you can acquire many items, the same as random items acquired from
the Barracks. Below is the list (from serenesforest.net) by category:

World Map --------------------------------------------------------------------

There will also be the completed world map and all the translations, but for
now Serenes Forest has a very convenient (and beautiful!) map with already
translated locations, so until I get around to writing my own, please redirect
your attention to this wonderful site!:

http://www.serenesforest.net/fe13/world.html

World Map Location Data -------------------------------------------------------

This section will give information on a location in the game. The map and
the stores are provided. (The map will have no enemies on it as skirmishes
may vary).

Some notes are made regarding how to unlock a map if needed, such as a
sidequest requirement.

You can begin buying items from the world map after Chapter 4. You can revisit
older areas, such as DLC maps and story chapters you have finished, and there
will be a list of items on display that you can buy. You can also forge
weapons, or sell items/weapons at these locations as well. This list does
not include wandering merchants (yet).

For weapon/item descriptions, check their respective sections. I provide
the same stats from the above lists, and Japanese characters so you know
which item is being referred to. Alternately, you can probably tell by the
price, or the weapon/item logo anyway.

Template:

Note: "Value" corresponds to the price in the store. If the selected character
has a Silver Card (avaliable in DLC), item/weapon price is halved.
Note: To find the corresponding location, when on an area on the map, look
at the top right to see what Chapter this location was used in, and find
it on the list below.

Note: When a wandering merchant appears, some items are added with a sparkle,
once an item is purchased the merchant disapepars and will reappear later.

==============================================================================

Fire Emblem games can be pretty in depth, so as you can imagine, this FAQ will
be constantly updating with more Chapters and information as time goes on!

I'm aware the character section is missing skills that the characters start
with, I will be sure to include this for Generation I characters at least
(as inheritance can get complicated) in future updates!

If you have any suggestions, or anything that may be helpful to other readers,
or see an error even as small as a typo, please feel free to email me! I like
the FAQ to be as easy to read and error free as possible, but obviously cannot
find all these on my own!

Likewise, if you have strategies you would like to add that work nicely for
some maps (as I do not have a lot of strategies listed yet), feel free to
email them and I will credit you for the contribution!

If you thought the FAQ was helpful, please recommend it to others who may
want to use it too!

Thanks for reading, cheers!

                          to May 17th. The Class section has been completed
                          minus opinions on each. Opinions on all characters
                          are still in progress. All normal class skills have
                          their respective Japanese characters added. Basic
                          items and their value have also been added, all
                          Fame bonus rewards posted. All swords have been
                          posted in the weapons section.

Version 0.60 [6/10/2012]: Completed the Weapons Section with the Japanese
                          characters as well. Added some Terrain translations
                          and effects in the Vital Translations section. Got
                          to the end of Chapter 3 in the Walkthrough. The
                          walkthrough will be the focus from now on with the
                          other sections secondary until completed (however
                          if other sections need work in some aspects or if
                          you have suggestions, please contact me!) Sidequest
                          Chapter 1 has been added as well.

Version 0.65 [6/15/2012]: Completed up to the end of Chapter 5 of the main
                          story, and the second sidequest. Began the World
                          Map data section; containing shops and simplified
                          map for Chapters completed in the walkthrough,
                          including sidequests. Minor corrections to weapons
                          and items were made.

Version 0.68 [7/12/2012]: Decided to take a different approach: Chapter maps
                          and recruitable units are given priority, and the
                          tips/walkthrough details themselves will be posted
                          after all maps are posted. This will ensure a
                          quicker, and smoother update. Chapters up to the
                          end of 13 have full maps with details. The shops
                          have been updated. Sidequests 6-16 will likely
                          be focused on for the next update before the main
                          story walkthrough continues. One DLC chapter per
                          update may be put in place as not to fall too far
                          behind.

Version 0.70 [8/22/2012]: Maps up to Sidequest 17, and Chapter 14 of the main
                          story are completed. The walkthrough will wait until
                          all maps are completed. Minor edits, corrections in
                          character guide. Some of the map specific guides
                          have the map but lack the shop details that will
                          appear next update. 

Version 1.00 [11/07/2012]: Phew! That took too long, outside work has been
                           really busy. As you can see, all levels have
                           their basic information/some strategies done, as
                           well as Sidequests up to 17 which covers all those
                           you get to the end of the story. All that is left
                           for future updates is the remaining sidequests,
                           and possibly the large amounts of DLC. The official
                           English names, when they come out, will be updated
                           accordingly.

Version 1.05 [01/17/2013]: Began adding English names in addition to the
                           Japanese ones in anticipation of the US release on
                           February 4th, 2013.

Version 1.05 [02/06/2013]: With the official US copy, I am going through the
                           lengthy adjusting process, and will now aim to
                           finish this guide 100%! Any and all help to doing
                           so is appreciated, and you will be credited
                           accordingly.

Version 1.10 [02/10/2013]: Started detailing maps in the sidequests, as well
                           as guides up to Chapter 13's end. I added a support
                           archive section that I will put in as soon as the
                           main walkthrough is done. But if anyone wants to
                           help compile, please see contact section. Began
                           adding Character Names, opinions, localized skill
                           names, etc as well!

Version 1.50 [02/13/2013]: The FAQ had a complete overhaul -- no longer in
                           shift_jis format, for reader convenience and ease
                           of reading. The Japanese characters have since been
                           removed, or in the process of being removed (such
                           as in the sub sections).

Version 1.75 [02/18/2013]: The Walkthrough is fully completed. The sidequests
                           that are avaliable up to now are completed. All
                           previous Japanese characters have been localized to
                           the US version of the game. All that is left is
                           the complete character opinions and the collection
                           of Support Conversations.

Version 1.80 [02/28/2013]: All sidequests up to current date, still some
                           final walkthrough things and DLC chapters to iron
                           out, and lastly class commentaries, but otherwise
                           done~ Just two more sidequests to go!
