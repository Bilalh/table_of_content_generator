March 28th, 2013:

Current Version 1.80:      All sidequests up to current date, still some
                           final walkthrough things and DLC chapters to iron
                           out, and lastly class commentaries, but otherwise

ABOUT THIS FAQ:
==============================================================================

This FAQ used to be in shift_jis format, but I gave it a complete overhaul
in order to be more pleasant to the eye. You may see "????"'s lying around,
these are the remainders of the Japanese characters that I am in the
process of eliminating.

There is a Character Guide and Items/Skills/Weapons list after the walk-
through, all characters and weapons are there, I'm just going through the
process of giving opinions on characters as readers suggested via email.

I hope you find what you're looking for. If not, email me and I'll put it in
if I think more people could use the information!

Below are some quick answers to common questions that I decided to put up
here rather than buried in the FAQ. If you have others to suggest that you
often see are asked, then feel free to contribute!

Onward!

General Tidbits/Questions ----------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I soft reset?

A: L + R + SELECT / START

Q: Why does my language keep switching?

A: Sometimes when you do soft reset, the language does so too. This can be
   fixed by going to Extras, switching to English, and then back to Japanese
   again.

Q: Is Fame carried over to the next playthrough?

A: Yes.

Q: Which of my save files' team is sent via streetpass?

A: You can only send one streetpass team at a time. Load a save file of your
   desired team, and send them out. If you want to change it, then dispatch
   a team from another save file the same way.

Q: Why can't I reclass from a Class 2 unit to another Class 2 unit with the
   Second Seal?

A: You have to be above Level 10 in the second class in order to do that,
   otherwise you can only change to Class 1 units.

Q: What is this about reclassing earlier on being better than getting to
   level 20 first?

A: There is a total level number the game keeps track of on each character.
   So, if you go to level 20 for the first class, then upgrade and go to
   level 20 of the second, you'd be at level 40 overall. Now, if you upgraded
   from Level 10, then changed class at level 15 of the next class, then
   you would have a total level of 25 only. The reason this makes a difference
   is because EXP gain slows down the higher your total number is, and it
   can be frustrating when your unit eventually only gains 8 EXP no matter
   the kill...

   As such, it's best to learn your target skill in a class and switch over
   to gather as many as desired while still easy to do.

Q: What if Anna is at the same spot as a Risen Skirmish?

A: Then she fights as an ally. If she doesn't die by the end of the mission,
   you get a special reward.

GAMEPLAY BASICS/INFO/CONTROLS                                            [GBI]
==============================================================================

This is Fire Emblem: Kakusei (Translates to "Awakening"), the 13th entry in
the Fire Emblem series, and the first on 3DS! It was released on April 19th,
2012 in Japan, and February 4th in the USA. It will be coming out in Europe
sometime in April.

In this section, I will provide you with the general controls, though it is
pretty straightforward, so should be easy to remember and get used to!

Other tidbits such as how the general flow of gameplay should work will be
provided too, though they are covered even for non speakers in the first few
levels' tutorials, I believe, but I will say so anyway!

I try to provide a lot of info, but most of it comes from just adjusting to
it yourself, you'll learn it a lot faster just by trying it in the game itself
rather than reading about it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Things to Consider when playing:
-Soon to come!

Gameplay Controls: (Not in detail, just what the buttons usually do)
-START - This is the button to skip! You can skip the enemy turn, skip battle 
         animations, and skip cutscenes.
-SELECT - Does nothing!
-R - It allows for angle changes. On the map, it allows you to zoom in/out.
-L - It allows for angle changes. On the map, it will scroll through units,
     jumping to the next one on the map, enemy/ally/other/etc.
-Y - On a map, Y is for rapid scrolling!
-X - In battle, X will automatically combine and highlight all enemy ranges.
     Other uses are swapping weapons when ready to attack.
-B - Usually to cancel something/go back. In menus, it will take you back,
     in battle, if your turn is not completed and you're just checking
     hypothetical movements, B will let you unselect the unit.
-A - You will use this the most, as it is for selecting options, units, etc.
     Selecting units allows them to move, pushing A on nothing brings up
     a menu, selecting enemies shows their range, etc.
-Touch Screen - Changes a lot! But on maps, you can select to either view
                a character profile, a map, etc. In battle scenes, you can
                pause, change angles, etc.

Unit Actions: (Translated in the Vital Translations section, check there if
               playing the Japanese version!)

Battle Scenes:

Assuming you left Battle Scenes "On" or "Custom" in the menu:

You can control various things during the battle, mostly just cinematic
effects rather than any outcome. You can hold down A to forward the battle,
or push START to skip it. The buttons on the bottom screen allow you to
change the angle as well as pause the battle. A lot of effort was put into
being able to enjoy the battle scenes more so.

==============================================================================
READING THIS GUIDE                                                       [RTG]
==============================================================================

The guide is more of an information provider than actually guiding you through
everything in a sense. A lot of the information is readily avaliable in the
game. There is no one way to get through a level, and so it is more general 
information in that sense.

Regarding Walkthroughs:

An example of a walkthrough chapter is below:

Mode: (Walkthrough chapters will contain various modes under the same chapter
       section, and so it will be listed here as either Normal, Hard, or
       Lunataic)
Chapter XX (Number) Chapter Name
Location: (Name of where it is on the map)
Condition: (Condition for clearing the chapter)
Boss: (Boss Information)
New Characters for Use: (If you get new characters, or have the potential to
                         do so, they will be listed here.)

Map: A map like the one below will be provided, if it varies by mode, then
     a note will be made and there may be an additional mode!

   X Row
   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  2  2
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5

10[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
Y Column

The above map uses X and Y columns. All coordinates given will be in X Y order,
meaning the Row FIRST, then the Column SECOND. So, (05,09) would be the Top
Row at 05, then go down to 09 on the column. A map will not exceed the double
digits (most of the time), so these digits remain double.

If the horizontal row (X) goes beyond 25 characters, there is a special
bracket in place, which is ")" rather than "]" This is in place since
gameFAQs has a 79 character limit, and so this is so I can extend the map
beyond 25 spaces without going beyond the limitation. The way it works is as
below:

   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  2  2
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5
01[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
02[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
03[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
04[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
05[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
06[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
07[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
08[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
09[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )
10[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ )

   2  2  2  2  3
   6  7  8  9  0 etc
01( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
02( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
03( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
04( ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
etc

X - etc
Y - etc
! - etc
etc

The example above shows additional columns in the X row, the special bracket
simply indicates where it continues from the first graph! Yet on the map
itself, it will be one long row. Makes sense, right? Since gameFAQs has no
vertical limit, it can be up and down as long as it wants, so the above only
applies to horizontal spaces.

Inside a bracket will be a mark to indicate something, for example, an enemy
may have [X] as a bracket, where as a point of interest may be [!]. It may
vary by the level, so please pay attention to the notes that will be right
below the map! (As shown by the "X - etc", "Y - etc" above).

Tips:

There will be a Tips section, or a General Strategy of sorts. I may add what
I did in some cases, and maybe an example of the sort of team I had at the
time, though since play styles vary as well as character preference, these
are just very general ways to go about winning a level.

Story Summary/Detail:

This is very tentative at the moment, but it will just summarize what is going
on right before the chapter begins for those who are interested. This section
will likely be shortened even more upon a foreign release of the game.

Other subsections of the walkthrough:

There are some subsections that contain item data and descriptions that may
be helpful. For specifics on those sections, check the respective sections.
The walkthrough information is provided here mostly to avoid clutter.

==============================================================================
VITAL GAMEPLAY INFORMATION                                               [VGT]
==============================================================================

This section is being reconstructed -- but is just a reference section, so
despite the title of the section, it's not too vital!

==============================================================================
WALKTHROUGH                                                              [WLK]
==============================================================================

This is a Walkthrough section for the Main Story, Side chapters, and DLC!
Enemy information will be provided (though can be seen on the map as well so
may not be in too much detail), a map that will provide information regarding
reinforcements, or recruitable units, bosses, positions, etc.

Sidequests are listed after the main story. They will be noted in the main
story when able to be unlocked, however.

They are listed separately for the mode you are playing. There will be
Normal Mode, Hard Mode, and Lunatic Modes listed. For the initial walkthrough,
Hard Mode will be priority, with Lunatic done second. Easy mode will be the
third one for those who may need it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting a New Game                                                     [W000]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's get started; select "New Game" from the menu.

(Normal - Green)
(Hard - Blue)
(Lunatic -Red)
(Lunatic +, Only unlocked after above is beaten)

"Normal" is the easy mode.

"Hard" is the standard difficulty that may get hard later on but shouldn't
be too bad.

"Lunatic" means you're a lunatic for trying! But it's for those seeking a
challenge, veteran or not.

"Lunatic +" is exactly that! 

Note: The initial walkthrough assumes you do Hard mode! I will try to do a
guide for those doing Lunatic at the same time, but it will not be prioritized,
if doing Normal, then the Hard mode guide should suffice as it's an easier
version of it.

Anyway, select a difficulty!

The next menu that comes up is asking if you want to play in Casual or
Classic mode:

Casual mode means that when a unit dies, they are not gone for the entire 
game as is Fire Emblem tradition! 

This allows you to lose units without too much of a worry as you'll get 
them back again at the end of the level!

Also Casual Mode allows you to save anywhere on the map at anytime during
your turn, this means you can resume from the point you last saved at. It
will use two save file slots as temporary data that are separate from your
main game!

Classic mode refers to the classical Fire Emblem style where any character 
can permanently die for the duration of the rest of the game!

In Classical Mode is also only the suspend option, rather than the save
anywhere option, which works very differently!

For both modes, if the main character or My Unit dies, it's game over!

Take your pick! I will be assuming you chose Classic Mode for the guide, as
it will assume you are trying not to get your units killed.

Now, it will lead you to your "Avatar" character creation!

Menu 1:

The first option is male or female. Choose which you prefer with
left and right, and A to make the selection. The gender differences effect
things that relate to gender-unique classes and some stat caps and who you
can marry, but aside from that there shouldn't be much of a difference!

You can make a second file with the opposite gender, so it's not like you'll
be missing out much!

Whichever Gender you choose, the following options are the same! So press A
on your desired gender to continue.

Menu 2:

Note: You can use the L/R buttons to change the viewing angle on the model to
      see if you like the hair, etc. You can press B to go back to the 
      previous menu before you confirm at the end.

Note: No map is provided as it is rather straightforward with only one enemy,
a boss that does not move, and no useful stat altering spaces.

Tips:

As it is a prologue level, there shouldn't be any difficulty, even on Lunatic
mode. Get used to how moving units around works, as the boss does not move
at all, and so you can pace yourself.

Feel free to get used to the menus, the way Player/Enemy phases work, etc.

If it is your first time, small tutorials will pop up on the bottom screen,
the images alone should give you the gist of what is being said.

For information on specific abilities/actions, refer to the Vital Translations
section!

When you're ready to go on, it may be helpful to just combine MyUnit with Krom
(select My Unit, then "combine" with Krom)

General Strategies:

Normal/Hard

Bunching yourselves together defensively and moving as a group is your best
bet for this map, especially on the harder modes. Frederick is nice to use
for this purpose.

Doubling MyUnit with Krom and making sure Liz is always out of enemy range,
and if she can't be, then paired with Frederick for protection. Use the
obstacles on the map as a way to make up for spaces you can't occupy with
your units!

Heal when needed and safe, and proceed very slowly to the bridge, and cross
when you're sure you'll be okay!

Lunatic:

Frederick is your friend! I recommend pairing your units up, Frederick will
be able to protect Lissa this way, and Chrom and your unit should preferrably
avoid trouble. Mages are a great danger to most of your units, so prioritize
wiping them out when possible. At this point a lot of units are a danger to
anyone not Frederick, so you may have to use him as your main unit throughout,
if he gets in danger, be sure to use vulenaries.

Story Summary:

"[MyUnit] is found lying in a field with no memory. After she/he helps Chrom
fend off a band of brigands, she/he is welcomed into the Shepherds as a
tactician."

O = Fort (Def + 2, Avoid + 20, Heal + 20)
   -Lower Fort also Event Tile

This map is full of woods, which provide some defense and avoidance, so it's a
good idea to stay in the woods while moving around to keep defensive. It is
also a good idea to try and attack the enemy when they have no terrain
bonuses, but won't make too big of a difference.

Doubling up and using the fortresses defensively is useful too, they heal you
every turn and provide a good defense and avoid advantage. Try not to let
the enemy stand on them.

Be sure to keep enemy ranges active (Pushing "X"), and keeping Liz out of this
range, as well as any other weaker units that may not be able to survive a
lot of attacks. The enemies tend to group together in this mission.

When Viole and Soiree come in, try to move them up through the woods and join
your main party, either doubling them or keeping them individual.

The map is pretty straightforward, just keep doubling, using terrain, and
knocking the enemies out one by one.

Lunatic:

This map on Lunatic is a whole different story. You have to rely on using
the terrain, doubling bonuses, and luck in general. Frederick is very useful,
but there is one enemy unit with a hammer who can usually kill him in one
hit. If playing Casual, you can easily sacrifice some units here and there
during the mission; if playing Classic however, you have to move really
carefully, keeping Lissa and other units out of range. It gets really tricky.

Be sure to keep enemy ranges open, and dance your way around it, making sure
the units you want in range to attack defensively are the only ones in range.

Story Summary:

"A chaotic night in the woods brings tremors and terrors, but a swordsman
named Marth comes to the rescue. Back in Ylisstol, [MyUnit] meets Emmeryn."

R = Miriel (Turn 2; Automatically on Team)

The map is much more open this time, with enemies spread across going
upward. You have quite a few units, though Vake can't attack as he doesn't
have any weapons on him (for the first turn at least). Doubling units you
want to support, or that you think will work well together may be a good idea
as you advance upward. 

Miriel comes in at R on the map at the start of the second turn. She has
Vake's axe, so be sure to trade it over to him so he can do something!

The steady advance forward may be helped if you take advantage of terrain,
again, and make sure the enemy isn't being fought on fortresses. It is best
to set up defensive formations with the stronger units taking hits for the
lower units behind them, or doubled up with them. You can always unequip
weapons on units to make them just take hits without fighting back, to allow
ranged units such as Archers or Mages behind them to build up experience
without being in danger of taking damage. You can create a choke point on
the bridge to handle the northern units this way.

Of course, play as you will, the map should be fairly straightforward as long
as you keep the more vulnerable units such as Liz out of harm's way. If you
feel like you are getting swarmed, it is okay to use Frederick as your
savior.

Lunatic:

What I did was I shoved everyone to the southwest, it took some tricky
coordination that involved Frederick on the hillside for the terrain bonus
and luck, as well as keeping everyone else out of enemy ranges. It worked
out eventually with health items too. Once you get past the opening bits of
the map, the rest should be easy if you lure enemies to Frederick, who is
preferrably on a fort. Be sure your other units are far away.

"Lissa introduces the other Shepherds. They head north to Regna Ferox to seek
military aid against the creatures from the woods, now named "Risen."

This is the first map you can choose to bring who you want. You have to bring
Krom no matter what. There is room for eight including him, so you will have
to leave one unit back at base as a minimum.

When you begin, there will be a cutscene, and Sumia will then join your team,
at space "S" on the map. Now when you are able to move, be sure to recruit
Callum who is "C" on the map, to your left. You must speak to him with Krom
in order to recruit him. He is a fairly useful Knight! He should be in Krom's
range right at the start of the turn.

There are quite a few Archers if playing on Hard mode or above, so be sure
to take extra care in keeping Sumia out of trouble, as they are extra
effective against her. Be sure to keep their ranges highlighted or in mind.

You can either split your team into two, or proceed one way (either left or
right), kill the enemies with the doorkeys, and then proceed up past the door
and reunite at the top. For more experience, you can always take your time
and wipe out the rest of the units. If in a hurry though, one way will be
much quicker.

If you manage to get the fighter who drops a hammer, that will help greatly
against the boss, as it is extra effective against armor. You can also use
Krom's rapier if he still has it, which he should assuming it was not broken
earlier. The boss will not move!

Lunatic: You will want to get Chrom to Kellam, recruit him, double up, and
quickly run back out of enemy range. Then, use Frederick as a lure and hope
that he can wipe out most enemies that attack him, though the archers may
cause a little trouble. Take them out the next turn if possible, Frederick
should be able to kill one (pending on his stats and who he's paired up with),
and use the rest of your units to kill the other.

Now you'll have to deal with the right side, I advise hiding the other units
and healing Frederick up, and sending him against the right side.

If you manage to survive this far, then you can use either the left or right
(I recommend left) door as a chokepoint, and let the enemies come to
Frederick. Beware of the enemy with the hammer! Aside from him, the rest of
the level should be straightforward.

Note: After completing this chapter, Sidequest 1 will unlock.

Story Summary:

"At the Longfort dividing Ylisse and Ferox, the Shepherds are taken for
brigands and attacked by the Ferroxi Guard. A show of force clears the matter

This is a pretty straightforward chapter, you simply have to move north and
defeat Marth. What may make it difficult is the fact you can only bring Krom
and 5 other members. You may want to pair compatible units together in order
to maximize, or move all units to one side to handle one side at a time rather
than dealing with both sides as you move upward.

The boss themselves aren't too difficult to deal with. If you bring Liz on
the level as a healer, just be sure to keep her out of enemy ranges as per
usual.

Lunatic: They come in swarms, the first two, then the second two, etc.
Frederick should try and take out the mages when possible, keep enemy ranges
open so he can outrun and heal when needed. Using the stairways is always
a plus.

Story Summary:

"To secure Ferox's aid, Chrom must defeat Marth in combat and win East-Khan
Flavia the throne. Meanwhile, the kingdom of Plegia kidnaps Lissa's friend
Maribelle."
